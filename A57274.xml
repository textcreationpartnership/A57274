            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE Reader.</head>
            <p>THAT Reaſon which, upon firſt thoughts, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of moſt force to diſſwade me from engaging my ſelf upon the Subject I have made choice of in theſe few following Sheets, (which was, its having been already undertaken by two ſo eminent Perſons, as the late <hi>Willis,</hi> and the preſent <hi>Vieuſſenius</hi>) upon ſecond be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the greateſt motives to it. Seeing that even after the beſt Proofs they have either of them been able to give of <hi>Skill</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:99585:4"/>or <hi>Induſtry</hi> upon this Subject, there hath yet eſcap'd undiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd both a great deal of the Materials which Nature is wont to furniſh for the framing of Parts, and Contrivance too in ranging of them, in order to bring about that great deſign of making them all contribute their ſhare to the conſervation of the whole.</p>
            <p>The truth of this becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill more evident whilſt I became more converſant in <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection,</hi> after ſome time, put me upon an endeavour, by a deeper Scrutiny, to diſcover ſomething more than what as yet had come to light: and this I undertook ſo much the more vigorouſly, as by how much I reckon'd it more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrable to contribute my Mite towards the perfecting of a Work already ſo happily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
<pb facs="tcp:99585:4"/>and ſucceſsfully carried on, than to break the Ice only (the common Fate of the firſt attempt) of another. With what ſucceſs I have done it the Reader muſt be Judge.</p>
            <p>Through the whole deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of Parts I have offer'd nothing but Matter of Fact, and have taken all poſſible care to avoid being impos'd upon my ſelf, by making Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments in proportion to my Doubts. Some of them have been upon Subjects in their natural, ſome in their morbid eſtate, ſome upon thoſe of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely Death; and on thoſe laſt ſometimes whilſt the natural Fluids remained in their proper Veſſels, though after a preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural manner occaſion'd by Strangulation, ſometimes when in the room thereof, other Bodies have been introduc'd
<pb facs="tcp:99585:5"/>by Injection, as <hi>Tinged Wax</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> the firſt of which by its conſiſtence chiefly, the other by its permanent nature and colour, contribute mightily to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards bringing to view the moſt minute ramifications of Veſſels, and ſecreteſt receſſes of Nature.</p>
            <p>By this various diſpoſition of the Subject it is that ſo great Difficulties are overcome in ſearch after Truth, many things appearing oftentimes very plain in one ſtate, which either lay concealed, or ſeemed otherwiſe modified in any of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>The Figures were delineated by the hand of that Compleat Anatomiſt Mr. <hi>Cowper</hi> the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, whoſe great Skill in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection renders that Talent ſo fortunate both to himſelf and his Friends: and how exactly
<pb facs="tcp:99585:5"/>that Work is performed, I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Severeſt Cenſure of any who will be at the pains to compare any of the Cuts to the life.</p>
            <p>What I have ſaid upon the <hi>Phyſiologia,</hi> in relation to <hi>Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Muſcular Motion,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on Microſcopical Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations; and as to the <hi>Poſtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> on which they both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, though at firſt ſight it may appear ſurprizing, yet I am confident it will become far leſs ſo to thoſe who have been acquainted with what hath been ſaid of the Vaſcular Compages of Plants by <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pighius</hi> and <hi>Grew,</hi> and of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Subjects by <hi>Lewen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoeck.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to conclude, I muſt confeſs I have been the better ſatisfied with it my ſelf, ſince I met with ſome Paſſages in the
<pb facs="tcp:99585:6"/>Works of thoſe learned Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphiſts Dr. <hi>Power,</hi> and of Mr. <hi>Hooke,</hi> relating to this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, in which laſt, the <hi>medium</hi> made uſe of for ſolution of that famous <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> of that Plants contraction at the firſt appulſe of Touch from external Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as well as the manner of its acting, is the ſame with that made uſe of here as a <hi>Poſtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> upon which the whole of what is ſaid about <hi>Muſcular Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is built: Altho' at the ſame time I am ſenſible 'tis not ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd in that place by the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Author, whoſe opinion in reference to <hi>Muſcular Motion</hi> (being the ſame with that of Dr. <hi>Mayow</hi> already taken notice of in the following Sheets) is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly otherwiſe in the account lie gives of thoſe natural <hi>Hygro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters</hi> the Beards of <hi>Wild Oats,</hi> of all the ſorts of <hi>Cranes Bills</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:99585:6"/>and <hi>Cats Guts,</hi> conformable to the manner of Nature's acting on which, in order to make them proper <hi>Indexes</hi> of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Changes of Weather (<hi>viz,</hi> by <hi>wreathing</hi> and <hi>unwreathing</hi>) he ſuppoſes that to be of <hi>Muſcular Motion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have quoted Authors, not out of oſtentation, but both for their Truth and Errors, to the end that at the ſame time we may ſee it reaſonable and convenient to read all they ſay, we may be render'd cautious how we believe; and to put us in mind, that as we ſind ſomething done to our hands by thoſe who have gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there is reaſon we ſhould do ſomething for thoſe who are to come after.</p>

            <head>THE INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>HOwſoever the <hi>Controverſie</hi> may ſtand amongſt Learned Men, about the Method and Order which <hi>Nature</hi> makes uſe of in the framing the different Parts of Animals, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as to precedency of Time, ſome of them ſuppoſing a rudimentary deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neation, or pre-exiſtence of the whole, which, at the Ingenious <hi>Bruner</hi> hath rightly obſerved, muſt neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply an actual exiſtence of the whole Race of Mankind at once, either in the <hi>Teſticle</hi> or <hi>Ovarium</hi> of <hi>Eve,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Learned <hi>Harvey, Malpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghius, Swammardam, &amp;c.</hi> or in that of <hi>Adam,</hi> according to <hi>Lewenhoeck,</hi> Dr. <hi>Garden,</hi> and ſeveral others, and conſequently muſt needs alſo infer an extinction of the ſame Progeny, as ſoon as the number of thoſe humane <hi>Germens</hi> or <hi>Animalcles</hi> ſhall be exhauſted; others a gradual formation of parts,
<pb facs="tcp:99585:7"/>one after another, by an inteſtine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion begun and carried on from the time of coition, by the ſubtle <hi>matter</hi> in the <hi>Cicatricula</hi> of the Egg: I ſee m reaſon to make my ſelf a Party on either ſide at this time, ſeeing the fineneſs of ſtructure and dignity of functions are ſufficient to give prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to one above another, and to render it more worthy of a particular conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. And this part I take to be the <hi>Brain,</hi> the delicacy of whoſe stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture is ſuch, that with no little reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to its divine Author, whilſt it gives us the greateſt and cleareſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of other things, lies moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed it ſelf.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:99585:8"/>behind upon any particular ſubject, than the endeavouring after a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and more nice ſcrutiny into it by ſuch means and experiments as ſerve to bring its moſt minute parts and texture under the test of Sence, which ſo aſſiſted, doth the ſame office to the diſcerning faculty at good arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Glaſſes do to it, bringing the Object and Judgment to ſuch a near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that even the first Link of the Chain becomes diſcernable, and the mechanical proceedings of Nature ſo highly inſtructive to the <hi>Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> in its finding out and aſſigning proper Cauſes to Effects much more obvious and intelligible.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore treat this Noble Part after the aforeſaid manner, with all the Justice I can, leaving thoſe inviſible, and almost divine things called <hi>Animal Spirits,</hi> to be trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of more at large, by thoſe more illuminated <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> who ſee best when their Eyes are put, and content my ſelf with making an inquiry into, and giving a deſcription of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever upon this Subject, by Diſſection, ſhall offer it ſelf as an Object of our Senſes.</p>

               <p>THE topmoſt part or <hi>Olla</hi> of the <hi>Cranium</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing removed, the firſt part of the <hi>Brain</hi> that comes in view is the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> which, with the ſubjacent <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> is accounted only an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper part of the Brain,</hi> ſtrictly ſo called, however of great uſe in many reſpects to it.</p>
               <p>'Tis by <hi>Spigelius</hi> and other Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts reckon'd, and I think not unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly, the thickeſt and hardeſt Membrane of the whole Body, enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the whole Brain, properly ſo called, ſomewhat loſely, ſticking al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt

               <p>In ſome places of the upper part of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> which on each ſide of the Sagittal Suture or Vertex are called <hi>Oſſa Bregmatis,</hi> it adheres not to the Bone, notwithſtanding the poſitive Opinion of <hi>Van Roonhuyſe,</hi>

               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:99585:9"/>
               <p>But as to the diſtribution of the double ſort of Fibres on each ſide this Membrane, I could not by any means find them agreeing with the deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Vieuſſenius</hi> hath given of them, as running in an oblique ſemicircular manner, externally from before back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and in the ſame figure internally from behind forwards; but far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, on the inſide, where they are very ſtrong, they ſeem manifeſtly to have three originals from the top part of the <hi>Proceſſus Falcatus,</hi> before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and in its middle; thoſe before running in a curved manner back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, half the length, and a great width of the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> and thoſe behind running after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner forwardly with this difference, that a great number of them bend ſoon after their riſe from that proceſs in a kind of a ſemilunary way to it again a little on this ſide the riſe of the middle <hi>Series</hi> of Fibres, others of them making a bigger arch after having ſtretched themſelves wider upon the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> bend back again to, and terminate in the Falx a little beyond the riſe of the aforeſaid middle <hi>Series</hi> of Fibres.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:99585:10"/>
               <p>Thoſe from the middle part of the Falx run backwardly, but leſs curved than the reſt, terminating as the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres which ariſe backwardly do, at ſome diſtance from the Proceſs in the inward Superficies of the <hi>Dura Mater.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to thoſe belonging to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſide or ſecond <hi>Lamina</hi> of the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> they are extream ſmall and obſcure, running from behind for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe, there are no leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable ones belonging to the Falx it ſelf, of two ſorts of Orders, the one running ſtreight about half the length of it, on its upper part, from before backwards, the other tranſverſe, from the inferiour or fifth <hi>Sinus</hi> to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour or third, on the hinder part of the Proceſs, and are moſt conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous there, as the other are towards its foremoſt part.</p>
               <p>As to the Uſe of thoſe Fibres, it may be remembred that this Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane conſiſts of two <hi>Lamina's,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween which the Veins which reduce the Blood from the Arteries, which furniſh the whole Brain with it, run for ſome ſpace after the manner of the Ureters in the Bladder, in large
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99585:10"/>Trunks, before they enter the <hi>Sinus;</hi> ſo that the Fibrous Conſtitution of this Membrane here, where the Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſſels are largeſt (together with the curved entrance of them into the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> eſpecially in an erect poſition of the Body) do the office of Valves, ſupport the weight, and promote the aſcent of the Blood. But that which is moſt conſiderable, is this, That if the inward <hi>Lamina</hi> of this part, which makes the inferiour and lateral part of the <hi>Sinus,</hi> was not in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure furniſh'd with additional ſtrength on this ſide ſuitable to that which it hath on the other, by reaſon of its coheſion to the Skull, the Blood which is continually running through it with no ſmall rapidity, eſpecially in great plenitude of the Veſſels or preternatural Ebulitions, would fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently burſt out, or at leaſt cauſe ſuch diſtentions as could not but be very injurious to a part ſo very exquiſitely ſenſible; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, tho' Nature ſeems plainly to have made a double proviſion againſt ſuch Accidents, by the tranſverſe Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments within the <hi>Sinus,</hi> and theſe ſtrong and numerous Fibres without, I have rarely open'd any ſtrangled
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99585:11"/>Body, where ſome ſuch Rupture, or at leaſt Diſtention, hath not hapned.</p>
               <p>This Membrane hath plenty of Nerves from the foremoſt Branch of the fifth Pair, and is thereby made very ſenſible, ſo that from any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation given it by the ill <hi>Craſis</hi> or undue motion of the Blood, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes accordingly affected. And as the various diſtribution of Fibres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſcribed ſerve in a natural eſtate to give a kind of ſpringineſs to the Veſſels, whoſe Coats are extended by the Blood as they run between the <hi>Laminae</hi> of this Membrane, to the end the ſame may be the more readily circulated through them; ſo in a preternatural eſtate, no doubt, they are ſubject to Spaſms, which may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard the courſe of the Blood in ſuch ſort, that in ſome kind of violent Headachs, where the Membrane is affected through overfulneſs of Blood, and particularly in thoſe which are wont to proceed from Vapours (ſo called) or Convulſive Motions of Nervous parts, we often obſerve a fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ruddineſs in the Face, attended with a kind of ſtiffneſs and ſoreneſs in the Eyes, proceeding doubtleſs from a ſtagnation in ſome meaſure of the

               <p>This Opinion of the Ancients, of its being the only other, and that a ſingle Integument of the Brain, was

               <p>Now, that there was a middle Membrane in ſome parts of the Brain, and particularly at the Baſis of the <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> from whence it's conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued down to the Spinal Marrow, conſtituting the ſecond proper Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of that part as afore-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I had long ſince-obſerved; but whether it be another abſolute di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Membrane from that other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent one, by the aforeſaid Authors properly named the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> and common to the Spinal Marrow with the Brain it ſelf, like as is this other
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99585:14"/>ſecond middle one too, or only one and the ſame Membrane double, as conſiſting of two <hi>Lamina's,</hi> may well be doubted of.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, for ſatisfaction concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this difficulty, I have lately made the ſtricteſt enquiry poſſible, and that in a ſubject moſt likely to afford a deciſion in ſuch a Controverſie, and this was an Human Brain extreamly hydropical, where there was no Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity or Interſtice, without abundance of Water extravaſated, inſomuch that where ever, according to the natural conſtruction of Parts, there was any larger than ordinary duplicature of this Membrane, as there are at the end of the <hi>Calamus Scriptorius,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ſuperincumbent <hi>Cerebellum</hi> and <hi>Medulla Spinalis,</hi> in the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> or ſpace betwixt the <hi>Cerebrum</hi> and <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellum,</hi> upon the Proceſſes called <hi>Nates</hi> and <hi>Teſtes,</hi> in the depreſſed part alſo of the Brain, between the beginning of the Annular Proceſs, and the firſt appearance or coming out of the Ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory Nerves, by <hi>Veſalius</hi> taken notice of and called a <hi>Proceſs of the Pia Mater,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Viſal.</hi> p. 794</note> there was found a great deal of Water diſtending this Dupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature much beyond its natural li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99585:15"/>ſo that by way of conſequence, if theſe Cavities were only Interſtices of two different Membranes diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inveſting the Brain, and not a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicature only of one and the ſame, the Water would then probably have inſinuated it ſelf betwixt them, and made them to have appear'd far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from what they did, agreeable to what it hath often been found to do in ſome <hi>Dropſies of the Belly,</hi> where the Water hath been found ſo to have divided or parted the double Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane of that Region call'd <hi>Perito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neum,</hi> as to have render'd it capable of containing the quantity of fifteen Gallons of Water, and upon a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the ſame after death, by cutting the external <hi>Lamina</hi> of that Membrane, the other inward one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet (unknown to the Diſſecter) left whole, to have impoſed upon the Spectators, and thoſe very ſagacious ones, ſo as that at firſt ſight, till after having recollected themſelves,<note place="margin">

However, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the like conformation here in this with the Membranes of the other parts, I attempted to divide it, and did ſo ſucceſsfully in many parts of it, but moſt readily in the beginning of the ſuperficial Plicatures of the corti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal part of the Brain, where there are naturally ſmall Interſtices, betwixt which many of the Blood-veſſels creep into and immerge themſelves in the cortical and medullary parts thereof: So that I think there cannot remain any further ſcruple of its being only a double, and not two diſtinct Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes of the Brain.</p>

               <p>The Advantages accrueing to the whole through ſuch a diſpoſition of this part, as hath already been obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, are very conſiderable, inaſmuch as that thereby firſt of all it becomes not only an Integument of incloſure, on behalf of the Brain, and the Blood-veſſels belonging to it in general, but of expanſion for Strength too, where the peculiar ſtructure of Parts, in ſuch places as were before mentioned, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt, the Brain is not only kept more warm, cloſe, and compact, and better defended on its depending part from the aſperity of the Bone it lies upon, but the Veſſels hereby more ſtrongly ſupported, and it ſelf ſecured from being broken or torn, whilſt between its duplicature they climb up into the Brain, whoſe deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate tender Fibres muſt otherwiſe of neceſſity have ſuffer'd violence by the largeneſs and pulſation of the Arteries, together with the weight of them, and the other reductory Veſſel, from which the <hi>Sinus's</hi> meet them.</p>

               <p>THE Veſſels belonging to this part in common with the reſt of the Body, though in reality but one continued Canal variouſly modified, yet, through the diverſity of Fluids they contain, go common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the denomination of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, Veins, Sinus's,</hi> and <hi>Lymphae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts,</hi> and not without good reaſon, perhaps, the <hi>Nerves</hi> may be in ſome ſence of the ſame kind too.</p>
               <p>The two firſt of theſe may, with relation to their different diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be deſervedly conſider'd in a two-fold reſpect, either as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the firſt Integument of the Brain, or the Brain, properly ſo called, it ſelf.</p>
               <p>The Arteries therefore belonging to this part called <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> or <hi>firſt Integument,</hi> are three fair Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches on each ſide.</p>

               <p>And that this Artery was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſtaken by, but unknown to the aforeſaid <hi>Wepfer,</hi> is plain, ſeeing he ſays, that from the very ſtyliform Proceſs, where the Carotid Artery does indeed enter the long Canal, to the place where it perforates the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> to enter the Brain, there is not one Branch ſent out from it; which Error, by injecting with Wax, which keeps longer in,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99585:19"/>and ſhews the Veſſels much better than ſmall tinged Liquors, had very eaſily been avoided.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Branch of Arteries aſcend into the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> by the ſixth hole of the <hi>Cranium,</hi>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99585:20"/>all-along after the ſame manner of diſtribution or ramification; which, if ſo, who ſees not that they muſt needs grow capillary towards the <hi>Sinus,</hi> and conſequently be uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of reducing the Blood into them, all reductory Veſſels being always capillary in the place from which, and not to which, they bring that which they contain.</p>
               <p>Now therefore, neither what the one nor the other ſays can poſſibly be true; for, as to the former the learned Dr. <hi>Willis,</hi> if his Aſſertion was good, it muſt of neceſſity fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that all the Arteries diſperſed thro' this Membrane muſt terminate in ſome of the <hi>Sinus's,</hi> otherwiſe there will want a reductory Veſſel; the firſt of which is contrary to ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar demonſtration, the laſt to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reaſon.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>Vieuſſenius</hi> the latter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what hath been already ſaid againſt him, if what he ſays in the place aforecited be true, that the Veins of the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> run con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitantly along with the Arteries, then they muſt of neceſſity anſwer the ends of other Veins throughout the whole Body, in reducing the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99585:20"/>Blood adduced by the Arteries, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Arteries they accompany diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their Blood into the <hi>Sinuſſes,</hi> (which, as hereafter ſhall be ſhown, they plainly do not) for otherwiſe, ſeeing they both grow capillary in their aſcent from the Baſis of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> they muſt neceſſarily be both adductory Veſſels, than which, by the Laws of Circulation, there can be no greater an Abſurdity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wepfer</hi> not knowing of theſe Veins, was forced to think, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to affirm, That the Arteries leave the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> in their extremities, and terminate in the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> and ſo have their Blood reduced by the Veins there; but this is evidently not ſo to the Eye of any who heedfully ſeparates this Membrane from the other.</p>
               <p>Before therefore I proceed to the deſcription of the Blood-veſſels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Brain it ſelf, which by the exactneſs of method I ought to do, I hope it may be pardonable, if I make a ſhort enquiry after the unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd diſtribution of Blood-veſſels Nature hath furniſh'd the Brain in general with, and the Reaſons of its procedure therein.</p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:99585:21"/>
               <p>The Truth then concerning this affair, is, That contrary to what hath hitherto been obſerved, the Blood-veſſels belonging to this part in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as hath already been obſerved, are of two ſorts, the one belonging to the Brain it ſelf, the other to its out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Integuments.</p>
               <p>Now, as to the firſt, 'tis obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the Veins enter not the Brain, nor run concomitantly, like as in other parts of the Body, with the Arteries, (the carotid entring at the fourth hole in the Baſis of the Skull, and the internal Jugular at the eighth; the Vertebral Artery at the laſt and largeſt hole of the Skull, and the Vertebral Vein at the ninth (which <hi>Vieuſſenius</hi> miſtakenly calls the tenth) thro' which it runs into the internal Jugular,<note place="margin">

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99585:21"/>meer Branches of the <hi>Sinus's,</hi> and conſequently I look upon the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus's</hi> themſelves no other than large Veins.</p>
               <p>The common reaſon all modern Authors give for this different diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of Blood-veſſels belonging to the Brain, from the other parts of the Body, is, that it may receive an equal warmth at the top as at the bottom, as being thereby very much aſſiſted in the production of Animal Spirits in an equal proportion all over; and that it is ſo may very well be granted: but, that Nature had yet another provident Intention, will be as evident, if we conſider, that if the Veins had aſcended with the Arteries thro' the holes in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> upon all great Ebulitions of the Blood, the pulſation of the Arteries would in that Stricture of the Veſſels made by the Bone, of neceſſity hinder the freedom of its return by the Veins, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occaſion a ſtagnation of Blood through the whole Brain, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſubverſion of all its faculties, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being more certain, than that upon any conſiderable abatement of circulation there preſently happens
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99585:22"/>by way of reſtagnation, a ſeceſſion of the watery and thin from the more groſs and red part of the Blood.</p>
               <p>The other way of the Veins en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the Brain (<hi>viz.</hi> thoſe appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its outward Integument, one at the ſixth hole of the Baſis of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> the other at the eighth, as aforeſaid) is, their aſcent with the Arteries after a quite different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from the former, even to their capillary Extremities; a manifeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication that they ſerve for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of ſo much Blood from the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> as the aforeſaid ſort of Veſſels, the Arteries, have brought thither; and although by reaſon of their ſmallneſs Nature ſeems not to have been ſo ſollicitous in avoiding the Inconvenience ſuppoſed to have follow'd, upon the Artery's entring the ſame hole with the Veins, taken notice of in the preceding Caſe, where they are very large, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Effect might prove much more injurious, yet Nature hath not been wanting in providing a Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy againſt it; as will plainly appear in the following Pages.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:99585:22"/>
               <p>From this manner of their entring the Brain at the ſame inlet of the Skull with the Arteries, may, for ought I know, be very rationally accounted for that violent trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Noiſe which many, in Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers ariſing from the turgeſcency of the Blood, cauſing a preternatural beating of the Arteries, do ſo much complain of; a Symptom happening from the Stricture before mention'd which the unyielding circumference of the Bone occaſions upon the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Blood-veſſels entring at one and the ſame Foramen, to which effect alſo the nearneſs of the <hi>Os Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſum,</hi> through which the Hearing Nerves do paſs to this hole, which is in that part of the Wedglike Bone that joyns to, or is conterminous with it, does not a little contribute.</p>
               <p>To the ſame cauſe, in ſome meaſure doubtleſs, may be aſcribed the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Headachs happening in Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, the Artery then ſo ſwelling and compreſſing the Vein againſt the edges of the Bone, that the Blood can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be returned back through it in a due proportion, and conſequently by its ſtagnation the Membrane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes inflamed and painful.</p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:99585:23"/>
               <p>So that conformable to what hath already been taken notice of concerning the wiſe contrivance of Nature, in ordering the different diſtribution of the Blood-veſſels, ſo as to avoid the Inconveniencies which might accrew to the Brain by compreſſion of the reductory Veſſels, occaſion'd through their entrance at one and the ſame hole with the Arteries; it ſeems very much worth our obſerving, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Veins of the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> which enter the <hi>Cranium</hi> together with the Arteries, as hath before been mention'd, there are alſo ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others belonging to this Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, having their riſe at, and their deſcent after a very remarkable manner, from a Vein hereafter to be deſcrib'd on each ſide of the Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinal <hi>Sinus,</hi> as you may ſee in the Figure,<note place="margin">FIG. 4. dd, nn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> and conſequently muſt grow capillary in their deſcent down from it, after a quite contrary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the other; and theſe do viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly inoſculate with ſome of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of the aforeſaid capillary Arteries, after the ſame manner as thoſe larger Veins belonging to the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> do with the Arteries
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:99585:23"/>belonging to the Brain and it, by which means it ſo falls out, that a conſiderable part of that Blood brought up by the <hi>Meninx Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> is carried back by theſe Veins, to the end that, eſpecially in all preternatural ſwelling of the Blood, the inconvenience of Compreſſion and all its ill conſequences happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by reaſon of an overfulneſs of theſe Veſſels, may be in a great meaſure avoided.</p>

               <p>AFTER this ſhort digreſſion, by order of Method, the Blood-veſſels belonging properly to the Brain it ſelf, fall under conſideration.</p>
               <p>The curious Anatomiſt <hi>Malpighius,</hi>

               <p>Theſe are either Arteries or Veins. The former go under the name of <hi>Carotid</hi> and <hi>Vertebral.</hi>

               <p>To go about to deſcribe diſtinctly the whole ramification of Arteries through this part, which as was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore noted, is here more remarkable for number and ſize than in any other part of the Body, would not only be to do what in a great meaſure hath
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99585:25"/>been already done by <hi>Vieuſſenius,</hi> in his ſixth Chapter, but ſeem to have alſo in it much more of oftentation than uſe.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore only take notice of ſuch propagations of them, as are either remarkable for magnitude, ſome curioſity of Structure, or uſeful deſign of Nature.</p>
               <p>And of this ſort may well be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Vertebral Artery, next after the Carotid, which hath already been deſcribed, as entering the Brain at the laſt and largeſt Foramen of the Skull, contrary to what Dr. <hi>Willis,</hi>

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99585:26"/>means whereof there is a communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwixt theſe two large Blood-veſſels, and that of great uſe and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to the Brain, for by this means it happens, that if even three of the four great <hi>Arteries</hi> which furniſh this part with Blood, were totally obſtructed, there would yet be a way left for a competent ſupply from the other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſtructed fourth. Theſe I call the <hi>Communicant branches,</hi> very ill pointed in <hi>Bidloo</hi>'s ninth Table, but very well in <hi>Vieuſſenius</hi>'s fourth; as may plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear here in the Figure taken exactly from Nature it ſelf.<note place="margin">FIG. I. dd</note>
               </p>
               <p>The ſtructure and ſinallneſs of theſe Arteries ſeem to ſuggeſt two, yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, provident Intentions of Nature.</p>
               <p>The firſt is the ſame it hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in ſeveral other places, as in the aſcent of the Blood by the Carotid Arteries, both which enter the Brain in a crooked line, the firſt at the fourth hole of the Baſis of the Skull, the ſecond from the hole in the tranſverſe proceſs of the firſt <hi>Verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra</hi> of the Neck, after the manner already in both places deſcribed. So in the like manner here, by the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs of theſe Branches, the Blood is in a great meaſure retarded in its
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99585:26"/>motion to the carotid Artery, and by conſequence to the Brain it ſelf, which, for Reaſons hereafter to be given in deſcribing the <hi>Sinus's,</hi> would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be in great danger of being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed with extravaſated and reſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Blood.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, a forcing the Blood more plentifully into the Spinal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, with which, tho' through the conical ſtructure of the Arteries in common it cannot be altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furniſh'd, yet by its perfectly-reflexed poſition, would have it very ſcantily, were it not that by reaſon of the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs of the aforeſaid <hi>Communicant-branches</hi> betwixt the two great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, the Blood was driven back in a ſort of a retrograde motion.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, there is a conformation of Arteries ſomething like this, tho' not altogether in the mammary and epigaſtrick Branches; but 'tis worth noting, that in both theſe places the main Artery from which theſe Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſpring is much more taper or conical,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. c c</note> and the ſucceeding export<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Veſſels far leſs both in number and ſize than thoſe of the carotid Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery here, whoſe foremoſt and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der lateral ramifications between the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:99585:27"/>Lobes of the Brain, bear an over-proportion to the Trunks from whence they come, and conſequently muſt, according to the aforeſaid ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of <hi>Malpighius,</hi>) in his Letter to <hi>Fracaſſatus,</hi> receive the blood brought thither far more freely and plentifully.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the Cervical Artery here is ſo far from being Conical, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made up of two vertebral Arteries joyning together, it is much wider than either of them ſingle, as appears plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Figure,<note place="margin">FIG. 1. g.</note> and conſequently would have carried away the Blood forwardly from the Spinal Artery more freely, had not Nature order'd the Structure of Veſſels after another manner here than it does in other parts of the Body, where there is not the ſame neceſſity of contrivance.</p>
               <p>One more Branch I take leave to mention only upon the ſcore of its never hitherto having been taken notice of by any, and that's a ſmall Artery attended with a Vein paſſing through the lateral part of the <hi>Os Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neiforme,</hi> (which conſtitutes the back part of the <hi>Orbite of the Eye,</hi> juſt under a very little Proceſs of that Bone, (which either by reaſon of its
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:99585:27"/>ſize hath eſcaped being ſeen, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable uſe, was never before, as far as I know, thought worth the mentioning;) and this, upon raiſing the fore Lobes of the Brain, offers it ſelf to the Eye of any heedful Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver.</p>

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:99585:30"/>he gives of them in the place here noted) ſeeing both the third, fourth,<note place="margin">Pag. 16.</note> two foremoſt Branches of the fifth, as well as its third hindermoſt one, together with the ſixth pair of Nerves, do not only run out of the Brain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed in ſo many diſtinct little <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſula's</hi> or Coverings made of the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> during their paſſage through that part of the Baſis of the <hi>Cranium</hi> by him call'd <hi>Receptacula, &amp;c.</hi> but even the whole <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> together with its Membranous Productions conſtituting the aforeſaid Coverings of thoſe Nerves, in that place ſticks cloſe to the Baſis of the ſubjacent Bone, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the External Proceſs of the <hi>Os Cuneiforme,</hi> on its under ſide, and to the Carotid Artery (which alſo both above and below (as was before noted) by its borrow'd coat ſticks cloſe to the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi>) on that ſide towards the aforeſaid Gland, leaving no room at all for either Blood or <hi>Serum</hi> to be contain'd there, as he would have it; tho' in the ſame place which he deſcribes for his Receptacles I have in ſeveral injected Bodies obſerv'd two very fair and large Veins, one coming into the <hi>Cranium</hi> at the ſecond <hi>Foramen</hi> from
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:99585:31"/>the Orbit of the Eye, (and poſſibly may be a Reductory Veſſel to that part) and ſo climbs up on the ſide of the lateral Proceſs of the Wedglike Bone, almoſt up to the <hi>Circular Sinus;</hi> the other at the fifth <hi>Foramen,</hi> which climbs up upon the ſame Bone till it meet and joyns with the other, from whence they make one ſhort Branch, which enters the <hi>Circular Sinus</hi> very near the place where the two other inferiour ones on each ſide deſcend down from it; which if they ſhould chance to be cut by accident in any enquiry made into that part, might cauſe an appearance of Blood, and thereby become an occaſion of the aforeſaid erroneous Hypotheſis.</p>
               <p>Neither is it poſſible (granting there were any ſuch Receptacles as he mentions) they ſhould ſerve to the end he aſſigns,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vituſſ.</hi> p. 55</note> ſeeing the <hi>Glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la Pituitaria</hi> is on all ſides encloſed by both the <hi>Dura</hi> and <hi>Pia Mater;</hi> which firſt (notwithſtanding what he ſays to the contrary) is on all ſides of this Gland of a very ſtrong and equal thickneſs; yea, in that very part where (as hath been before ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of) there is a kind of a Chaſe made by a certain duplicature
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99585:31"/>of the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> conſtituting the foremoſt part of the <hi>Circular Sinus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if this alſo was granted, yet would the manner he deſcribes of the <hi>Serum</hi> or Water getting into theſe Receptacles (which is by tranſcola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) render his Suppoſition very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, ſeeing 'tis by no means conformable to the Cuſtom of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in all other parts of the Body that Arteries ſhould depoſe a <hi>Serum,</hi> or any thing elſe but Blood, (except what goes for Nouriſhment to the Part it ſelf) in any Part, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing furniſh'd either with its Excreto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or Secretory Ductus, neither of which was ever pretended to have been found here.</p>
               <p>And as a thorow confirmation of all this, ſaid in oppoſition to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Hypotheſis, I ſhall only add this, and conclude, that in ſeveral Injecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made uſe of in order to find out the uſe of Parts, I never found one drop of the tinged Liquors on that ſide of the Carotid Artery, where he hath made the ſituation of theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles.</p>
               <p>The uſe of this <hi>Circular Sinus</hi> is in common with the reſt to reduce Blood returning from all the adjacent parts, as the Pituitary Gland, the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:99585:32"/>Wedglike Bone alſo, and it may be from the <hi>Rete Mirabile,</hi> which in Brutes is very large, and therefore ſeems to require the Service of this <hi>Sinus,</hi> either mediately or imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, for reducing a ſhare of its Blood, ſeeing the <hi>Glandula Pituitaria</hi> appears no where furniſh'd with Veins terminating any where elſe ſufficient to carry off the refluent Blood from this <hi>Plexus,</hi> notwithſtanding <hi>Vieuſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> ſaith on the contrary it hath no Veins, and therefore is forc'd to have recourſe to thoſe ſmall Branches of Veins which accompany the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſent out by the carotid Artery, before it perforate the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> with the Optick Nerves, or thoſe which go to the <hi>Gangliforme Plexus</hi> of the fifth Nerve, or thoſe coming out of the Wedglike Bone, for redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory Veſſels to this Part; but with what probability I know not.</p>

               <p>I took off the upper part of the Skull of a Dog alive, by which means the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> with its third <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitudinal Sinus</hi> lay bare to the Eye and Touch, to neither of which Senſes, at firſt, either any beating of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99585:33"/>the Membrane in general, or of the <hi>Sinus,</hi> was the leaſt diſcernable. After ſome pauſe, by chance the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> it ſelf, which I deſign'd to have open'd with a Lancet, being touch'd with a cauterizing Iron (which in making the Experiment there was occaſion to make uſe of) pour'd out the Blood very violently, and at firſt without any very remarkable pulſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but alter ſome time diſcernable enough, both as to the Blood and Membrane too.</p>
               <p>I cut this <hi>Sinus</hi> through almoſt the length of it, to ſee whether any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries (whereof many, according to <hi>Vieuſſenius,</hi> which was alſo long afore affirm'd, and that upon Experience too, by the learned <hi>Wepfer,</hi> did ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in it, and ſo occaſion its beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">

               <p>After all which 'tis manifeſt the <hi>Sinus</hi>'s themſelves have no pulſation, other than what is communicated to them from the ſubjacent Brain, which contrary to what <hi>Bourdon</hi> affirms, hath an evident pulſation through the multitude of Arteries diſperſed thro'<note place="margin">

                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:99585:33"/>it ſo forcible as to create a ſenſible <hi>Syſtole</hi> and <hi>Diaſtole</hi> in its outward coverings.</p>
               <p>'Tis worth noting, that while the Blood-veſſels are all full, ſo as to keep the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> upon its full ſtretch, the pulſation is not vi ſible at all, or at leaſt very faintly; but after a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of the Veſſels, ſo, as that grows ſomewhat more lax, the beating be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes very viſible, equally in the <hi>Sinus</hi> and Membrane too.</p>
               <p>After having made this Experiment I found one Author of the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and that is <hi>Falloppius,</hi> who in vindication of <hi>Galen</hi> againſt <hi>Veſalius,</hi> his Contemporary, ſays, all I have ſaid upon the foregoing Experiment, and all the great <hi>Veſalius</hi> was able to anſwer in his own vindication in his ingenious Book call'd <hi>Anatomicam Gabr.

               <p>As to the Tranſverſe Ligaments which are in ſome places<note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:99585:34"/>of by <hi>Vieuſſenius,</hi> on the under and outſide of this <hi>Sinus,</hi> from whence the Fibres belonging to the falcated Proceſs aforemention'd ſeem to have their original,) Elaſticity to this part for its more vigorous reduction of the Blood paſſing through it, together with its blind Cavities or Diverticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lums ſerving to moderate the over-ſwift or violent motion of the Blood; ſeeing I find them ſo exactly deſcrib'd by <hi>Vieuſſenius,</hi> to whom the Reader may have recourſe, I think their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription need take up no room here.</p>
               <p>But as to the manner of the Veins entring this <hi>Sinus,</hi> I find it far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from that which is deſcrib'd by <hi>Lower</hi> firſt,<note place="margin">

               <p>And this is as follows,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fig.</hi> 4. dd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>(viz.)</hi> About one half of them (tho' intermixedly) (but all, after having firſt upon their ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val at the <hi>Sinus</hi> inſinuated themſelves for ſome ſpace alter the manner of

               <p>Now, by this contrivance 'tis plain, that firſt of all there are made two contrary Torrents in one and the ſame Channel, by which means the refluent Blood, made poor by the vaſt quantity of its richeſt parts drawn off as it were into Animal Spirits, thro' a colliſion of Parts, which by this contrivance muſt needs fall out, is preſerv'd in its due mixture, which when at any time loſt through the languiſhing of its inteſtine motion or elaſticity, retards even its circular or progreſſive motion, which when it happens but in ſome degree, is the cauſe of many Diſtempers; and when altogether, of Death it ſelf.</p>
               <p>In the next place the circulation is at all times not only ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded, and the Blood hinder'd, (toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the help of the bony Cell at which the internal Jugular Veins enter the <hi>Sinus's</hi>) eſpecially in an erect poſture, from deſcending with that rapidneſs and weight it would
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:99585:35"/>otherwiſe have done upon the deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Cava</hi> to the Heart; but alſo much more ſo retarded in a ſupine poſition of the Head, a poſture moſt natural and ordinary for Mankind to take their reſt in, through which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance, in concurrence with that of the Lateral <hi>Sinus's,</hi> (whoſe ſtructure is ſuch, that in the aforeſaid poſture the Blood is forced to climb upwards before it can arrive at the place of its deſcent into the Jugular Vein) there is made a more plentiful gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Animal Spirits, one chief Cauſe of the great refreſhment and vigorous diſpoſition of the whole Body we find after Sleeping.</p>
               <p>As to the other manner of the Veins entring this <hi>Sinus,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> from before backwards) it from thence happens, that in a prone Poſition of the Brain, a poſture not uncommon amongſt Men, the Blood is help'd forward in its circulation through the <hi>Sinus;</hi> the truth and deſign whereof are at once both evident and pointed at by Nature from the Structure of this part (and which therefore ſhews the great uſefulneſs of Comparative Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy) in Brutes, who by reaſon of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:99585:35"/>ſuch a Poſition, which the neceſſity of Feeding almoſt always keeps them in, have always ſuch a diſpoſition of this Part, to aſſiſt the Blood in its heavy circulation.</p>
               <p>The deſign of Nature in making theſe Channels ſo wide on a ſudden, in reſpect to the Branches of Veins lately treated of terminating in them, ſeems to correſpond with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the Parts juſt now trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, and with that it had in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Ramifications of Arteries afore taken notice of ſo large and unproportionable to the Trunks from which they ſpring, which is a flower than ordinary circulation of Blood through the Brain, in order to make a ſtill more copious production of the Animal Spirits ſo called. Which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Deſign and End of Nature had nevertheleſs been attended with a very great Inconvenience, <hi>(viz.)</hi> an extravaſation of too much <hi>Serum,</hi> the uſual effect or conſequence of a ſlac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd Circulation, had it not been for another provident Contrivance of Nature in the two Communicant-branches, betwixt the Carotid and Vertebral Arteries aforemention'd,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:99585:36"/>
                  <hi>p.</hi> 36. by the narrowneſs of whoſe Channel the influent Blood is in ſome meaſure repreſt in its motion, and an overcharging the Veſſels with Blood prevented.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Sinus's</hi> differ in ſtructure one from another, the Longitudinal and Lateral ones having many tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Ligaments which the other have not, and the Longitudinal having ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſmall Cavities or blind Diverticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lums, as aforeſaid, which the Lateral have not; the uſe of them all being for ſtrengthening and defending them from giving way to the violent ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Blood into them, againſt which ſometimes notwithſtanding they are not able to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; as I have ſeen in many Skulls ni which the Blood hath burſt open the ſides of the <hi>Sinus's</hi> and found its way between the Duplicature of it, ſo as even to have made a <hi>Fovea</hi> or Cavity in the <hi>Cranium</hi> it ſelf, as was before noted, one of which I have now by me.</p>

               <p>THIS <hi>Plexus</hi> is an aggregate Body made up of <hi>Arteries, Veins, Membrane,</hi> and <hi>Glands,</hi> double on each ſide, (which hath not before been taken notice of) and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently having two Originals.</p>
               <p>The firſt Original is from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Branch of the Communicant Artery,<note place="margin">FIG. 1. ee.</note> which running backward up betwixt the hinder Lobes of the Brain, (in which for ſome part of the way it is immerged, and to which it gives many large Branches) and the <hi>Medulla Oblongata</hi> at length arrives at the Lateral Ventricles,<note place="margin">FIG. 5. ee.</note> and makes one part of the <hi>Plexus</hi> on each ſide.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Original is from the hindermoſt Branch of that Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant Artery,<note place="margin">FIG. 1. <hi>ſecond</hi> ee.</note> which running more backwardly, aſcends betwixt the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Limbs of the Brain and the <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebellum,</hi> till it comes to the <hi>Iſthmus,</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:99585:37"/>where communicating with the firſt Branch abovemention'd, they make a reticular broad Expanſion, which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers both <hi>Nates, Teſtes,</hi> and <hi>Glandula Pinealis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">FIG. 5. GG</note> and conſtitutes the ſecond or other part of the <hi>Plexus Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roeides.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt Branch begins to divide it ſelf into divers Network Fould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, interſperſed with Glands ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what what before it enters the Ventricles,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> 5.</note> and continues ſuch to its Extremity on each ſide, where they both under the <hi>Fornix</hi> wind croſs the third Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle into a mutual inoſculation.</p>
               <p>The ſecond begins to aſſume the ſame ſhape or contexture as ſoon as it begins to enter the <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing ſuch throughout its entire abovemention'd Expanſion.</p>
               <p>Theſe two on each ſide are joined together by a twofold connexion, the firſt is by an Artery running un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Bombyces,</hi> intervening betwixt them, which could not be here inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo as to come in view.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is by a production of the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> which is extended all over theſe parts of the Lateral Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles, and the third Ventricle which
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:99585:37"/>lyes betwixt the firſt two parts of the <hi>Plexus</hi> forwardly, and down to the other two hinder parts of the <hi>Plexus</hi> backwardly under the <hi>Fornix</hi> and <hi>Septum Lucidum;</hi> ſo that whatſoever Water is tranſmitted out of theſe Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles, muſt ſlip down not only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Fornix,</hi> but that Membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Production it ſelf; from which kind of ſtructure and poſition of this Membrane may probably be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood how there might happen ſuch an <hi>Hydrocephalus</hi> as the learned <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi> mentions,<note place="margin">

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:99585:38"/>ſuch a one as the latter found there and drew out with his Fingers; and that which ſeems to put out of all Controverſie that it was ſo, is, that in thoſe places, both above towards the <hi>Corpus Calloſum,</hi> and below on the Baſis of the Ventricle, he found ſome ſort of Aſperities as though the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der fill'd with Water had been cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ſome ſmall Protuberances not much unlike to White Poppy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed, in thoſe places where it was contiguous to them; which Protu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berances doubtleſs were the ſmall Glands interſperſed quite through this <hi>Plexus.</hi>

               <p>The Glands belonging to this <hi>Plexus</hi> are very many, but very ſmall, and their Uſe, according to all the Moderns, eſpecially <hi>Willis, Duncan,</hi> and <hi>Vieuſſenius,</hi> to carry off the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundant watery part of the Blood, but that without ever ſhewing by what rational contrivance of Structure it can be done, ſeeing none of them aſcribe a Secretory Duct, which muſt always be in readineſs when any unprofitable part is to be diſcharg'd.</p>
               <p>Since therefore this part is found furniſh'd with <hi>Lymphaeducts,</hi> 'twill be no hard matter to conceive the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine uſe of the Glands, which is, to

               <p>Another Uſe it hath been thought to have, is, to carry off a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble quantity of a dull watery part of the Blood, in order to the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the finer Animal Spirits; and this it is thought to effect by means and help of the Pituitary Gland, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt which and it ſelf there is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly obſerv'd a greater affinity, the one being either greater or leſſer in proportion as the other is ſo, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt, which there are in all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but more remarkably in thoſe where they are both large, a diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of ſeveral Branches coming from the aforeſaid <hi>Rete.</hi> And this is look'd upon by <hi>Vieuſſenius</hi> ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable an office of the <hi>Glandula Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitaria,</hi> that in thoſe Creatures where it is but ſmall, as in Men, Horſes, Dogs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he hath ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted many,<note place="margin">

               <p>Now, as to this office of the <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dula Pituitaria,</hi> I cannot eaſily be perſwaded it is either deſign'd for, or capable of it, till ſuch time the Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of this Opinion can be able to ſhow me it furniſh'd with an Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Duct for this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>And if they offer, that the Veins are ſuch, I reply, That (beſides its being very unprobable that ſo vaſt a quantity of Blood as continually is brought by the Carotid Arteries to the Brain, ſhould be able to get rid of any conſiderable quantity of its Seroſity, by ſo ſmall a part as the <hi>Glandula Pituitaria</hi> is;) 'tis not the

               <p>Moreover, granting (which by no reaſonable means is to be granted) it were ſo as they would have it, yet nevertheleſs, in conformity to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's proceedings in all ſuch-like caſe, there ought to be an interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate paſſage by way of a Secretory Duct, which none hath been able hitherto to diſcover.</p>
               <p>And ſo far as <hi>Vieuſſenius</hi> ſeems to be of this opinion,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vieuſ.</hi> p. 102 par. 3.</note> which in one place he plainly is, making it of ſo groſs and viſcid a nature, as is only ſit to be diſcharg'd at the Emunctory of the Noſe; the ſame Reply is ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory: But when by way of flat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to himſelf he comes to make the ſame groſs Humour a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect fine <hi>Lympha,</hi> the Anſwer is then,<note place="margin">

               <p>THIS Gland is ſeated in and fills up in a manner all that ſpace contain'd within the <hi>Sella Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cica</hi> (Veſſels only excepted).</p>
               <p>'Tis cover'd on all ſides with the <hi>Pia</hi> and <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> excepting that part on its upper Superficies, in which there is a little round hole, by which the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundibulum</hi> deſcends ſlopingly into it, being at its entrance inviron'd with a Production of the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> for its more firm connexion with that part, as was before noted.</p>
               <p>But as to the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſes it after a far different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than what <hi>Vieuſſenius</hi> hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vieuſſ.</hi> p. 51 par. 5.</note> not ſuſpending it in Man as it doth in Brutes, ſo as to hinder it from touching the bottom of the <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> and that foraſmuch as there is not the ſame reaſon for its ſo doing in one as there is in the other, for in
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:99585:44"/>Brutes the <hi>Rete Mirabile</hi> is not only ſituate on each ſide this Gland, but: runs quite under its hinder part, by which one ſide of the <hi>Rete</hi> commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates with the other, a Diſpoſition of this Part which <hi>Vieuſſenius</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unacquainted with; whereas in Man, inaſmuch as there is not that ſort of Structure in the one (<hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Rete</hi>) 'tis not ncceſſary it ſhould be requir'd in the other.</p>
               <p>However, in neither one nor the other is the Reaſon which <hi>Vieuſſenius</hi> gives for Nature's contrivance of this affair of any weight, ſeeing neither the <hi>Rete Mirabile,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vieuſſ.</hi> p. 50 par 1.</note> much leſs the few ſmall Veins belonging to the Bone beneath, could poſſibly any way be compreſſed by this Gland, though ſuperincumbent, becauſe it is ſo firmly knit to the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above and upon it, which is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the two foremoſt and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermoſt Proceſſes of the <hi>Sella Turcica,</hi> in ſuch a manner as is ſufficient to ſuſtain and keep from preſſing upon any ſubjacent part ten times a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter weight than the <hi>Glandula Pitui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taria</hi> is.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> is ſo far from ſuſpending it from that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:99585:44"/>Bone, that it is, together with the Gland, fixed to that very Bone it ſelf.</p>
               <p>The ſubſtance of this <hi>Gland</hi> is far differing from that of all the reſt, which I have often upon this account particularly examin'd; in conſiſtence indeed 'tis the ſame with moſt of the Conglobate kind, if not ſomewhat harder, but then being preſſed or ſqueezed, it emits much more Water than any of them.</p>
               <p>As to the Conglomerate ſort, it hath not the leaſt reſemblance to any of them, and conſequently cannot be ſuppos'd, as it hath hitherto been by all, to carry off any excrementitious or unprofitable pare of the Blood.</p>
               <p>Now, if we conſider this part, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the appended <hi>Infundibu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,</hi> we ſhall certainly find a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation far different from any other part in the whole Body of Man, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as that which this Gland receives by the <hi>Infundibulum,</hi> or which is the ſame, what this <hi>Infundibulum</hi> conveys to it, is not ſeparated from the maſs of Fluids by any viſible Secretory Duct, which in its ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry method Nature is obſerv'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to make uſe of, whenſoever
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:99585:45"/>it parts with any part of the Blood, whether excrementitious or reductitious, throughout the whole compages of the Body.</p>
               <p>Nor hath the manner of Nature in tranſmitting a certain Liquor to the Gland been leſs abſtruſe in carrying it off from that part again, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductory Veſſels from the Gland be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equally conceal'd, as the addu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to the <hi>Infundibulum;</hi> that way of Tranſudation, according to the invention of <hi>Vieuſſenius,</hi> being to the greateſt degree improbable, as having no reſemblance to the courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture throughout the whole Body.</p>
               <p>Nay, even a poſſibility it ſelf ſeems hardly allowable, if we take but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of that part in Brutes in whom its Integuments are extraordinary denſe, the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> as he truly obſerves, inveſting it cloſe on every ſide, (and which he perceiving, and conſequently foreſeeing what might from thence unanſwerably be objected againſt him) was forced to make them much more than in Men; in which laſt indeed there is ſeemingly. ſome reaſon for its being ſo,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vieuſſ.</hi> p. 52 par. 2.</note> inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the <hi>Rete</hi> lies in a Duplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as it were of the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> on
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:99585:45"/>each ſide of the hindermoſt part of the <hi>Sella Turcica,</hi> as tho' one <hi>Lamina</hi> of it was ſpread upon the ſubjacent Bone, and the other over the <hi>Pitui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Gland,</hi> (a diſpoſition contrary to that in Brutes, as hath already been taken notice of) but neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there is no neceſſity that it ſhould be ſo divided in this place, nor doth the ſaid Author ever offer a Reaſon for its being ſo, (which looks as though his Aſſertion was only a Gueſs) ſeeing this Membrane can ſend out new Productions as well double as ſingle, as we find in its two eminent Proceſſes before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd, and <hi>Sinus's;</hi> agreeable to what it alſo therefore may and does do here, where the Integuments of this part appear plainly to be of too thick a conſiſtence to admit of his imaginary way of tranſudation, which is manifeſt not only by ſight and ſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but in that by the greateſt force made uſe of in compreſſing and ſquee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing it between ones Fingers, we find it impoſſible to force out the leaſt appearance of Humidity through its aforeſaid Incloſure or Integuments,</p>
               <p>Being therefore very inquiſitive after the true uſe of this part, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:99585:46"/>deſpairing of ever attaining to ſuch a Knowledge without firſt knowing the exact Structure thereof, beſides all other means commonly made uſe of in all Anatomical Enquiries, I made uſe of all ſorts of Injections ſerviceable to ſuch an end, as of tinged Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, Wax, and Mercury, but all with little, if any, ſucceſs according to my expectation, the Wax not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating its Texture at all, the tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Liquors but very ſuperficially, and the Mercury, (where my chief Hopes were) always by its weight (do what I could to the contrary) either breaking through the ſides of the <hi>Infundibulum,</hi> where it leaves the Brain, or elſe falling down in greater <hi>Globuli</hi> than the extream narrow Paſſages were capable of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting. and by this means became altogether uſeleſs.</p>
               <p>Being compelled therefore for the preſent to leave off a little while a further enquiry into the Structure of this part, by reaſon of the great miſt it is involved in, and to gain a little more Light for our Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance in ſearching after Truth, (which like many other things of greateſt value lyes deep, and is

               </p>
               <p>In Man it is cloſely inverted with the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> at its very entrance into the Gland, and from that place hath not any manifeſt Cavity I could diſcover by blaſt or ſtyle, but is altogether of a medullary ſubſtance, contrary to what it is in Sheep or Calves, in which laſt Creature, where the Parts are lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, by inſerting a Blow-pipe into that part of the <hi>Infundibulum,</hi> next to the Gland, I have ſeen its further Tract or Paſſage on the upper part thereof a little puffed up, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable

               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:99585:48"/>
               <p>Now, as to the <hi>Plexus</hi> and <hi>Glands</hi> before mention'd, 'tis evident by what hath been already diſcover'd and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly given an account of in the preceding Pages, they are furniſh'd with <hi>Lymphoeducts,</hi> as proper redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory Veſſels; ſo that ſo far the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy is vaniſh'd.</p>
               <p>But as to the remaining Gland, I am not ſo fond of gueſſing to ſay it hath any, and conſequently all I can ſay is, that as I look upon the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundibulum</hi> to be no more than a large <hi>Lymphoeduct</hi> variouſly ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mified through the <hi>Glandula Pitui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taria,</hi> diſcharging its Liquor by thoſe many ſmall Branches into the Veins diſperſed through that part to be reduced after the manner 'tis in all other Secretory Glands back to the Blood gain.</p>
               <p>And that which ſeems moſt to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour this Conjecture, is the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary humidity of this Gland, eſpecially in Brutes, above the reſt of the whole Body, as ſerving not only to export what <hi>Lympha</hi> is ſeparated from ſeveral Arteries diſperſed thro' it, but that alſo which it is charged with from the Brain it ſelf.</p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:99585:48"/>
               <p>And to this twofold manner or double office of Secretion is owing the two diſtinct Subſtances it ſeems to conſiſt of, the one being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to that part of the <hi>Lympha</hi> coming from the Brain, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whitiſh, the other to that ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated immediately out of the Blood, and is therefore reddiſh.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, As to the manner how the <hi>Lympha</hi> paſſes down thro' the <hi>Infundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulum</hi> paſſes down thro' the <hi>Infundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulum</hi> from the Brain to the <hi>Glandula Pituitaria,</hi> I look upon it to be in the form of condenſed Vapours ariſing from the Arteries of the <hi>Plexus Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roeides,</hi> emitted thence for the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moiſt and in good order that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Production of the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> ſpread all over its <hi>Parietes,</hi> which being a membranous dry part of it ſelf, might otherwiſe become inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to that fine medullary part lying under and being contiguous to it; in which there is a continual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Animal Spirits, whoſe Tracts, and conſequently they themſelves, through any the leaſt intemperance of this Membrane, would be in great danger of either ſome obſtruction or diſorder.</p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:99585:49"/>
               <p>And that this <hi>Lympha</hi> is only the reſult of the aforeſaid Vapours, I am the more readily enclin'd to believe, becauſe I never ſaw Water in that part of any ſound Brain, nor unſound neither, where the <hi>Plexus Choroeides</hi> was firm; and there was no reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ground, by the extravaſation of <hi>Serum</hi> in ſome other remote parts of the Brain, to believe it had its riſe from thence.</p>

               <p>THE Gland call'd <hi>Pinealis,</hi> from its Figure, is about the bigneſs of an ordinary Pea, prefix'd to the two Prominencies call'd <hi>Nates,</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to be deſcrib'd, at the end of the third Ventricle, immediately un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the broad and hinder part of the <hi>Fornix,</hi> (with which nevertheleſs it hath no connexion,<note place="margin">

               <p>In an hydropical Brain of a ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Boy, I have ſeen it ſwelled to a ſize of three times its ordinary mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, and by reaſon of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſtagnate gelatinous <hi>Lympha</hi> contain'd in it, perfectly tranſparent.</p>

               <p>THAT part of this Treatiſe relating to the Veſſels, being diſpatch'd, I ſhall in the next place proceed to an account of the Brain it ſelf, under which term are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally comprehended the <hi>Cerebrum</hi> and <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> and <hi>Medulla Oblon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gata,</hi> which Parts being in many reſpects ſo different one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, may juſtly challenge a diſtinct and orderly deſcription.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Brain</hi> then, in the firſt place, as diſtinct from the other two, is that large and almoſt ſpherical Body which comes firſt to ſight in the old way of Diſſection, filling the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of all that ſpace contain'd in the <hi>Cranium,</hi> conſiſting of two different Subſtances (firſt taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of by <hi>Archangelus Piccolominius</hi>) both in Colour, Conſiſtence,<note place="margin">

And as to the manner how this is done, it will appear very plain and intelligible, after the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Structure of the Part hath been more accurately enquired into.</p>
               <p>The Curious <hi>Lewenhoeck</hi> made a far deeper ſcrutiny into theſe two Parts,<note place="margin">Lawenh. de Struct. Cereb. <hi>p. 37.</hi>

               <p>'Tis true, even by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, that his moſt nice and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Inſpections could not free him from many Scruples about what he ſaw; yet ſome things to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe were plain enough, as Reticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Bodies of a red colour, which being larger in the Cortical Parts than Medullary, helps to give it that greyiſh or <hi>ſubrunneous</hi> colour, as he calls it.</p>
               <p>Nextly, a tranſparent Vitrous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour'd Subſtance contain'd in moſt minute Veſſels; whence 'tis plain there are two ſorts of Liquors in this Cortical Part, one of a red co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, or Blood, contain'd in larger Veſſels, whoſe <hi>Globuli,</hi> which give it its redneſs, either by reaſon of their ſize or figure, cannot enter thoſe ſmall Veſſels which with the Fluid contained in them conſtitute this tranſparent, cineritious, or cortical part of the <hi>Brain.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:99585:53"/>
               <p>The other a tranſparent Liquor, contained in moſt minute Veſſels, as aforemention'd; from whence I am induced to believe this Cortical part to be only an Aggregate of different Veſſels, (as alſo I do of all the reſt of the Parts of the Body) containing different ſorts of Fluids.</p>
               <p>Of theſe Veſſels ſome contain a more compound Liquor, commonly call'd Blood, which whilſt in that ſtate, by reaſon of the <hi>Globuli</hi> ſwimming on it, looks red, and by reaſon of a tubulous Pore of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſize and figure ſo continued to the Veſſel we call a <hi>Vein,</hi> that it undergoes a continual quick circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
               <p>Another ſort of Veſſels there is which receive and contain a more ſimple fluid body, of a thin tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparent nature, which when in ſome parts of the Body, gives the name of <hi>Lymphaeducts</hi> to the Veſſels that it runs in; but when in theſe Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, which are diſcover'd to make up the great Subſtance of the Brain, whether Cortical or Medullary, may be allow'd the name of <hi>Fluidum Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:99585:54"/>
               <p>And this laſt ſort of Veſſels I look upon to be either a certain Protenſion of an Artery, by its ſmallneſs render'd capable of hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a ſort of Liquor only as the laſt ſpoken of, or elſe ſuch a tubulous production of the Artery as by its Orifice of Pore anſwers to the figure and ſize of the Fluid it is by Nature intended to receive.</p>
               <p>Upon the ſame exact Enquiry made by a Microſcope, the medul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary part of the Brain appears to be of the very ſame conſtitutive parts, ranged only after a ſomewhat different manner, which makes this part appear more white, as was before obſerv'd. But over-and-above (if it may be allowable to make a Conjecture) I am enclin'd to think the Whiteneſs of this part may be owing in ſome, if not the greateſt part, to ſuch a narrowneſs of the Veſſels diſcover'd here, containing the pellucid Subſtance aforemention'd as will not entertain any Fluid what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, without its being firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd into very minute Particles, or <hi>Septometry</hi> ſo called: Which laſt Veſſels I therefore ſuppoſe to be
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:99585:54"/>only yet more Capillary Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the aforeſaid Cortical Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, as they are of the red or Blood-veſſels indu'd with ſuch a Pore as fits them only for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of a moſt ſubtile, fine, ſoft Liquor, which I eſteem the true Medullary and Nervous Juice, which being contained in its proper <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſula,</hi> and many of them collected into one <hi>Faſciculus,</hi> at its egreſs out of the Brain, being there wrapped up in more thick and ſtrong Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings made of the two outward Membranes of the Brain, do conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute that part we call a <hi>Nerve,</hi> which having all its Integuments or Membranous Incloſures always kept turvid and tenſe by its contain'd Fluid, after a ſlow and leiſurely manner continually diſpenſed from the Fountain, and by its growing more taper towards the place of its termination, by which means it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a greater ſtreightneſs or nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs of its Pores ordinarily call'd <hi>Fibrillae,</hi> it ſo falls out that all inward Impreſſions, upon all occaſions, are the more eaſily and ſpeedily tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted through it.</p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:99585:55"/>
               <p>The very ſame notion alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Nutrition (which in the trueſt ſence is only an appoſition of Parts nouriſhing to Parts pre-exiſtent to be nouriſhed) in the reſt of the Parts of the Body, I have thought reaſonable to entertain ever ſince, by aſſiſtance of the Microſcope I have plainly diſcern'd the Veins to be only continuations of Arteries, and the Blood to run in the ſame Channel variouſly modified, without the leaſt ſuſpicion of Extravaſation, <hi>(viz.)</hi> a continual tranſmiſſion of Nutritive Juice out of the Pores of Arteries, after many windings like Tindrils of Vines (<hi>Analogus</hi> to which the red Reticular Bodies of <hi>Lewen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoeck</hi> ſeem to be in the Brain,) grown very capillary into certain <hi>Tubuli's</hi> or Pores of a correſponding bigneſs and figure, making up the whole fleſhy part of the Body, whoſe Subſtance, when 'tis freed by waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or injection of Water, we ſee to conſiſt only of large and ſmall Blood-veſſels and Fibres; which laſt, whether Nervous or Membranous, or ſuch as relate to Muſcular Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, commonly called <hi>Carnous,</hi> I
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:99585:55"/>ſuppoſe to be full of minute diſtinct Veſſels for the communicating and receiving their proper Liquors or Fluids after the manner already ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, which as contain'd in the ſaid <hi>Tubuli</hi> or Pores, whilſt they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Natural Conſtitution and Proportion, I preſume it is which keeps the Habit of the Body plump and vigorous, the more thin and languid being perpetually carried back by the Lymphatick Veſſels, and a great part wholly extermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by meer ſimple Tranſpiration; which I adventure to think is not only ſuperficial from the Sudorifick Glands in the Skin, but alſo through the whole Subſtance of inward parts, through ſmall <hi>Canaliculi's</hi> or <hi>Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus's</hi> in even the <hi>Viſcera</hi> themſelves; by which, not unlikely, we may gueſs at the Meaning of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>All things were conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and tranſpirable.</hi>

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:99585:58"/>well as thoſe carnous ones of Muſcles, which laſt are tubulous, 'twill not be in the leaſt unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to inferr, That theſe Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies being kept continually turgid with the contained Fluid, are equally capable of tranſmitting or receiving Impreſſions of the Object, as if they were ſtretched longitudinally like a Bow-ſtring from each Extremity, according as <hi>Borellus</hi> hath obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>

               <p>And here I cannot but take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that all they who contend for Animal Spirits, analogous to thoſe we ſee produc'd from various Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects by Fire, as the only adequate <hi>medium</hi> for all ſorts of <hi>Muſcular Motion,</hi> have been forced to have recourſe either to certain Tracts or Interſtices betwixt the Filaments of the Nerves continued from the Brain, or the Original of the Nerves through their whole Productions to the Muſcle, of which ſort are the <hi>Carteſians,</hi> or elſe to a certain Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Juice, for their place of reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, of which ſort are moſt of the Moderns, and particularly <hi>Vieuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius,</hi> by which Paſſages, or out of which Juice theſe fine inviſible things are either voluntarily, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Soul, or inadvertently, from ſeveral either inward or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward impreſſions, tranſmitted, in order to produce Motion: which if true, and the only ways of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing <hi>Muſcular Motion,</hi> I beg leave to ask, how it comes to paſs, by
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:99585:60"/>either of theſe ways, that when ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon bends my Arm, and that againfl my Will too, the bending Muſcles of the Arm become as tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid as when voluntarily or inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertently contracted at any other time; which hath been truly obſerv'd tho' not ſatisfactorily accounted for, by Dr. <hi>Croone,</hi>

                  </note> or any other I know of.</p>
               <p>But how this or any other ſort of contraction of a Muſcle happens, does by the other afore-mention'd Hypotheſis become explicable, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any manner of difficulty at all: For when the Cauſe of Contraction is from the Command of the Soul, the preſſure is firſt from the Fluid in the Brain, by which all the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent or continued Fluid ſlows to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Part to be moved, the ſame proportion of Fluid being at the ſame inſtant transferred into its room from the relaxed Muſcle; and when the contraction of the Muſcle is from the above-mention'd external force bending the Arm againſt my will, then the Liquor contained in the relaxed carnous Fibres or <hi>Vaſcula</hi> is tranſmitted through the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity of Fluids, to that which is contracted, and all this without being
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:99585:60"/>beholden to the wild Conceits of a dry and moiſt part of the Nervous Juice, blind Paſſages, inviſible <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buli</hi> betwixt the Antagoniſt Muſcles or Valves in the Nerves, by a meer <hi>Aequilibrium</hi> of the Fluids contained in the Veſſels the Parts conſiſt of.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time I am not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of the Solution ſome have given this Inſtance of Involuntary Motion upon another Hypotheſis, <hi>(viz.)</hi> by ſuppoſing an equality of Tenſion or Elaſticity in all the Muſcles of the whole Body; by which means it falls out, that when any new additional force (though never ſo ſmall) is added to the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres of any Muſcle, as in voluntary motion, or the power of Elaſticity in the Antagoniſt Muſcle, overcome by outward force, as in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Inſtance of Involuntary Motion, the other Muſcle then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes contracted.</p>
               <p>Now, that this is one concurrent Cauſe in both ſorts of Inſtances, as being confirm'd by the Experiment of cutting a Muſcle through, either towards the Extreams or in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, by which the Fibres, by their
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:99585:61"/>natural Elaſticity, are found to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract either to one or the other, or to both Extreams, is allow'd to be true; but to be the only Cauſe, is altogether as falſe.</p>
               <p>For, in the firſt place, as to the caſe of voluntary Contractions, it is allow'd to proceed from a tranſmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Spirits from the Brain into the carnous Fibres, (that Hypotheſis of <hi>Steno</hi> to the contrary having been convicted long ſince by <hi>Borellus,</hi> in his Book <hi>De Motu Animalium</hi>) though not without the concurrence or ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praxis of the natural Elaſticity of the Fibres belonging to the Muſcle to be contracted.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe, without the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Animal Spirits from ſome force or another, I deny even the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of that ſtiffneſs or hardneſs which is eaſily preſerved in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted Muſcles, feeling and ſeeming as though they were indurated and ſwelled out, as really they are, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be in the caſe of voluntary or involudtary motion; in confirmation of which, I affirm, that though by the cutting of the carnous Fibres of any Muſcle through, which way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:99585:61"/>it be, the contracted part may, and doubtleſs does, grow thicker by the ſhortning of its Fibres, yet by that means only it does not become ſtiffer and harder, ſo as we find Muſcles do when contracted by any natural Cauſe, nor is there any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity it ſhould do ſo, according to any Rules of Mechaniſm, ſeeing the Fibres ſhortning only by their own elaſtick force, when they find the circumambient ſpace give way have no neceſſity of ſubintration of parts, which is always requiſite to procure a ſtiffneſs or hardneſs to a part al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering its dimenſions as Muſcles do, from a longer and thinner to a ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and thicker circumference; and upon this it muſt needs follow, that in a Muſcle contracted by involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary force (in which Action the Brain is altogether unconcern'd) that ſtiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or hardneſs then perceivable in it, muſt needs be owing to the Fluid or Spirits in the antagoniſt Muſcle, after the manner already explained, tranſmitted to it.</p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:99585:62"/>
               <p>Now, to define what ſort of thing this Animal Fluid (ſo called) is, I ſee no occaſion to frame any other Idea of it than what we ordinarily have of the pureſt Liquors, ſeeing the Nerves are a Subſtance which (to the Senſes of either Smell or Taſte diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers very little elſe than what is inſipid) are always reckon'd amongſt the leaſt hot parts of the Body, and doubtleſs far leſs warm in Fiſhes than us, who yet have as great a ſtock of Animal Spirits as any other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And this Conſideration may be it was that occaſion'd an Author to give the Animal Spirits the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thite of <hi>Frigidiuſculi.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>'Tis plain enough, that the Veſſels which contains this Fluid are extream minute, and conſequently the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent muſt needs be of a very fine and depurate conſiſtence, though without much reſemblance to either the aforeſaid nimble, ſaline, or ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurous Productions of the Fire.</p>
               <p>'Tis in a continual, gentle, direct motion, though perhaps contained in curved or reticulated Veſſels, from its original ſource to the ends of the carnous Fibres, from whence
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:99585:62"/>it is convey'd into the Membranous or Tendinous Productions, according as the Fibres terminate, and it may be by filtration only; in which, as in other, and particularly in Glandulous Parts not ſubſervient to Muſcular Motion, where Nervous Ramificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are very copious, whether it be of any other uſe than to keep the Parts in their proper tone, in order to their regular diſcharge of the office of Secretion, muſt ſtill remain a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, notwithſtanding all that hath been yet advanced againſt it, inaſmuch as waſtings and numbneſſes of Parts, the common Symptoms of obſtructed or divided Nerves, (which doubtleſs by their haſtening through ſuch Cauſes to Muſcular Parts, gave the firſt riſe to that Conjecture about the Exiſtence and Uſe of that Juice throughout the whole Body) are equally explicable by the want of Tone, as of that ſuppoſed Liquor.</p>
               <p>To the proof of all this an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment frequently made does not a little contribute, and that is the injecting the Arteries of a Dog, or any ſuch Creature, when dead, upon which there immediately hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:99585:63"/>a contraction of the Muſcles, according to the different ſtrength of them, <hi>(viz.)</hi> of the Extenders in the hinder Legs, and of the Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the fore Legs, though the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection be only of cold Water, the reaſon of which effect in particular, if it be remembred what hath been before obſerved, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that the Blood-veſſels do moſt certainly enter the compoſition of the Nerves them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, will not only become very eaſily explicable, but the whole Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis at leaſt very highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, That this ſpeedy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantaneous reflux of the Animal Fluid is oppoſed by the aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned conſtant direct motion it hath from its Source to the parts to be moved, 'tis eaſie to reply, That its ſlow direct motion that way is caſily overcome and repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the violent impulſe of the forcibly-relaxed Muſcle the other way.</p>
               <p>If further it be demanded, by what means it ſo happens that in the Inſtance before us of an Arm bent by force, that the refluent Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:99585:63"/>Fluid is rather towards the Muſcle, which by that means then proves contracted, than towards any other whatſoever, to all which it may indifferently have acceſs, I think the Solution ſeems not difficult, if it be conſider'd, that at the ſame time that the one Muſcle is forced from, the other is forced into a contracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; from whence it ſo falls out, that the carnous tubulous Fibres of the laſt, which by being extended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſtate of relaxation, did loſe their cavity, muſt needs by their natural elaſticity, when freed from the preponderant force of its Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt, acquire it again, by which means a ſpace being made, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled Fluid, by the Laws of Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (to ſay nothing of the habitual motion of the Animal Spirits, or Liquor, by moſt Authors, eſpecially <hi>Borellus,</hi> urged as a Reaſon for this effect) muſt needs be driven thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>In fine, though I am not averſe to think moſt of the <hi>Phoenomena</hi> relating to Senſation and Motion may be ſolved by this Theory, tho' of ſo ſmall an <hi>apparatus,</hi> yet I am ſo

               <p>Outwardly 'tis convex and corti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, exactly divided into two Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheres by the firſt Proceſs of the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> called <hi>Falx,</hi> from the bony Proceſs called <hi>Criſta Galli</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to the very hindermoſt part of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> where theſe two Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions are ſtretched over the <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellum,</hi> from which part alſo 'tis per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſeparated by the ſecond Proceſs of the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> to the end it
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:99585:65"/>may not cauſe any prejudicial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon that part, either by its weight or pulſation.</p>
               <p>The foremoſt Diviſion is made on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as deep as the <hi>Corpus Calloſum,</hi> the latter to the very <hi>Medulla Oblongata</hi> it ſelf.</p>
               <p>'Tis further imperfectly divided into four Lobes, two whereof (which being the leſs) are forwardly, and two (which are much bigger) backwardly.</p>
               <p>Theſe Diviſions appear beſt in the inverted or <hi>Varolian</hi> Diſſection, being marked out as it were by four Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Carotid Artery, two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and one on each ſide.</p>
               <p>Theſe I call <hi>Imperfect Diviſions of the Brain,</hi> becauſe though the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> runs betwixt them, together with the aforeſaid Branches of the great Artery, yet they adhere by ſeveral Fibres, both of that Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane and the Blood-veſſels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>'Tis alſo imperfectly divided thro' all its external cortical part by the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> though not ſo profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to the end the Blood-veſſels may penetrate this part in more ſine and reticular Ramifications; and that by
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:99585:65"/>the pulſation of the Arteries the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terjacent cortical Glands, (or rather Veſſels) may more freely make their proper Secretions.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVI. <hi>Of the</hi> Nerves.</head>
               <p>IN the ſame poſition of the Brain we alſo have a ſit time of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a view of the Nerves, which are ſtill medullary Productions of the Brain diſperſed to all the parts of the Body, which have need of either Senſe or Motion, and theſe are in number ten Pairs or Conjugati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, having their Names and Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals as follows.</p>
               <p>The firſt is the <hi>Olfactory Pair,</hi> which after they leave the former Lobes of the Brain, and begin to run to the Bone called <hi>Ethmoides,</hi> take the name of <hi>Proceſſus Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millares;</hi> but this is chiefly in Brutes, where through their largeneſs they have that appearance, and are manifeſtly hollow.</p>
               <p>By the utmoſt Scrutiny I have been able to make, they have but one Original, and that is from the undermoſt and foremoſt part of the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:99585:79"/>
                  <hi>Crura Medulla Oblongata,</hi> where they advance on each ſide into the Globous medullary part of the Brain, from whence running concealed betwixt its foremoſt and hinder Lobes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely, for a good ſpace, at laſt they come in ſight, as you ſee them in the Figure: And by what means <hi>Vieuſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> comes to find ſuch diffuſed Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals for them as he ſpeaks of, I know not.</p>
               <p>Their Uſe is known to moſt, and a particular account thereof, as of the reſt, together with the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Senſation, with relation to the external Organs of Senſe, is much more fit for a Phyſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Tract than one of this kind.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore only at this time give a general deſcription of the Nerves belonging to the Brain, how and where they ariſe, the difference or variety whereof ſerve very well to inform us, according to ſeveral late Theories, concerning the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Reſervatories of the Animal Fluid or Spirits, and the different diſpenſation of the ſame to ſeveral parts of the Body.</p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:99585:80"/>
               <p>The ſecond Pair are called the Optick or Seeing Nerves,<note place="margin">The Second Pair. Ibid. <hi>2 2.</hi>
                  </note> of which I ſind no more Originals than of the former, and that is from thoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dullary parts called <hi>Thalami Nervo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Opticorum,</hi> tho' <hi>Vieuſſenius</hi> ſays they are from ſeveral parts; and <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> in general terms from the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Thalami Nervorum Opticorum,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the <hi>Corpora Striata:</hi> which deſcription is more exact in <hi>Quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peds,</hi> where the <hi>Thalami Nervorum Opticorum</hi> are altogether in ſituation behind the <hi>Corpora Striata,</hi> than in Men, where a great part of the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pora Striata</hi> are ſituated on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides of the <hi>Thalami Nervorum Opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum,</hi> and only their Heads or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities before them.</p>
               <p>The Blood veſſels mention'd both by <hi>Willis</hi> and <hi>Vieuſſenius</hi> belonging to theſe Nerves, I have ſeen to run not only upon or with them, but alſo in injected Bodies exactly quite thro' the medullary ſubſtance of them, into the reticular Coat of the Eye, wherein they end in an infinite number of the moſt capillary Ramifications, which by an injection of that Artery
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:99585:80"/>made with Mercury, become very delightfully conſpicuous to the Eye.</p>
               <p>The Nervous Fibres alſo, from the fifth and third Pair of Nerves, do twine about the Bodies of theſe Nerves, as the two above-mention'd Authors do truly affirm, but how rightly they both aſſign to them the office of dilating and contracting them ſubſerviently to the viſory fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and preternaturally in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions of the Eye, as though theſe Fibres were truly Muſcles, or of the carnous kind, I refer to the Judgment of others.</p>
               <p>Theſe go out of the Skull at its firſt <hi>Foramen.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>THE Nerves thus conſtituted, become accommodated for Uſe in relation to their ſeveral and diſtinct Functions, in ſome conſiſting of Sence only, ſuch as are thoſe appertaining to the particular Senſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Smelling and Seeing Nerves, as alſo the ſoft Proceſs of the Hearing Nerve, ſome Branches of the fifth, and it may be of the ninth Pair, for Taſting; in ſhort, all the Nerves belonging to thoſe external Senſories, by way of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, and in a leſs eminent or general way all the Nerves of the whole Body, which are diſtributed to ſuch Parts as by reaſon of their ſtructure are capable of Senſation on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, any of which, as furniſh'd with the Nervous Fibrils, but more eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Cuticula,</hi> my properly be call'd
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:99585:88"/>an Organ or Senſory of <hi>Feeling;</hi> in others of <hi>Motion</hi> chiefly, ſuch as are all the whole Syſtem of Nerves, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting them only afore-mention'd) ſes, which though in a leſs eminent manner, are nevertheleſs ſenſitive Nerves alſo: In others of both, in all reſpects <hi>(viz.)</hi> either in a more eminent or leſs eminent Senſation, and Motion too, with relation to the different Fibres they conſiſt of in their Originals, as the fifth and ninth Pairs.</p>
               <p>Theſe two different Functions of Senſation and Motion are executed after two as different manners.</p>
               <p>The firſt of which, being occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd from external Objects, is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged by a preſſure thereof made on the Inſtrument of Senſe, ſo that the Motion is backward irom one Extream of the Organ to the other, where it terminates in the <hi>Commune Senſorium,</hi> commonly ſo called, and is therefore ſtiled <hi>Perception, Paſſion,</hi> or <hi>Affection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other is diſcharged by ſome manner of impulſe upon the Organ from within outwardly, with a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency either to acquire ſome Good,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:99585:88"/>or avoid ſome Evil; by which Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe, when carried on ſo far, either in a natural or moral ſence, as to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in, or to be executed upon its proper Object; the Object then may be ſaid to ſuffer as before in the other caſe it might be ſaid to act, and the perceptive Faculty now to act as before it might be ſaid to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and this Action is commonly called <hi>Local Motion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For whoſe ſake, ſeeing 'tis of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent kinds, learned Men have thought ſit to organize or divide the Brain into two diſtinct Provinces inveſted with ſeveral Rights and Juriſdictions abating the Power of the Senſitive Soul, which before was looked upon univerſal over the whole Brain, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing it only a principal, but no abſolute Empire there: And this they have done upon no weak or unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable grounds, ſeeing that <hi>Local Motion</hi> is not only in many reſpects performed without its aſſiſtance, but even againſt its power of reſiſtance; as in the Pulſation of the Heart, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micular Motion of the Bowels, and in a great meaſure the Act of Reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:99585:89"/>
               <p>Now, that which hath been taken from the Brain hath been conferr'd on the <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> to which, though ſome Power in this Affair may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be allowed, as was before obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, yet poſſibly not altogether ſo much as there hath been.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Willis,</hi> who is Chief in this Cauſe, having diſtinguiſh'd <hi>Motion</hi> into voluntary and involuntary on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hath made the <hi>Cerebrum</hi> accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for the one, and the <hi>Cerebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi> chiefly for the other; and to that end hath furniſh'd it with the like number of Nerves, as in his own words is expreſſed,<note place="margin">

               <p>I am apt to think that Learned Perſon too ſoon fell in love with his firſt Thoughts, the ordinary reaſon of either ones ſeeing falſe, or not far enough.</p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:99585:89"/>
               <p>Nothing being more apparent, than that moſt of thoſe Actions of Animal Motions he calls <hi>Involunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and of which he gives ſo many Inſtances, are equally found in Brutes and rational Creatures too, whilſt in the ſtate of Infancy, as well as when grown up with <hi>this</hi> only difference, that all of them in the laſt are under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouling power of the Soul, and conſequently may be ſuſpended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a reflex'd Act of the Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; whereas in Brutes and Infants they are neceſſary, and do as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally enſue upon the impulſe of the Object, as Water, when unconfin'd, runs towards a Plain.</p>
               <p>Now, if all theſe were ſuppoſed to be under the power of the <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellum</hi> only in Brutes and Infants, the Brain it ſelf muſt neceſſarily be thought altogether uſeleſs in them.</p>
               <p>It will be neceſſary therefore to take notice, that there are two ſorts of Animal Motion in Brutes, as in Rational Creatures, the one purely natural, ſuch as is Pulſation of the Heart, and various contraction of the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> proceeding from a certain por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:99585:90"/>of the Animal Fluid continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpenſed to the Nerves in an equal proportion, and ſo may be ſaid to have their cauſe origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally co-exiſtent with the Creature, and always preſent: And this kind we find by a moſt convincing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment hereafter to be mentioned, to be from the <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely free from the dominion of the Brain, in its ordinary way of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or influx.</p>
               <p>The other is that of <hi>Inſtinct,</hi> relating to the Senſative Soul, or an aptitude of the Nervous Structure, to act according to the Impreſſions made upon the Nerves, either from within, or from without, and ſo may be ſaid to depend on the preſence of ſuch Cauſes as are ſupervenient and extraneous to Nature, ſuitable to the impreſſions whereof the <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> either purſues or avoids the Object, obeys, or reſiſts the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe.</p>
               <p>Now, I take it for granted, that no body will deny but that the Nerves (by vertue whereof theſe laſt actions of <hi>Inſtinct</hi> are performed) whether th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:99585:90"/>are equally under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Soul; or elſe, as I ſaid before, the Brain in thoſe Creatures is to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>And of this ſort I reckon all thoſe actions in rational creatures of <hi>Inſtinct</hi> before they have attain'd to the uſe of their <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> from any ſort of Impreſſions, or inadvertent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſulted, when he hath the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouling power of Reaſon allow'd him and makes no uſe of it, ſuch as are called <hi>Habitual,</hi> which at firſt were produced by command of the Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Part only, but through frequent repetitions at laſt, without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from that, out of a blind obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to a bare impulſe from the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; or laſtly, ſuch as happen when he hath altogether loſt the uſe of it, as in Sleep or Diſtraction; in which laſt Caſes 'twill be very difficult to diſtinguiſh him from a meer Machine or <hi>Automaton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, from what hath been ſaid, I cannot but think it plain, that many of the Actions before ſpoken of in Dr. <hi>Willis</hi>'s ſence, by him called <hi>Involuntary,</hi> as proceeding
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:99585:91"/>from the dominion of the <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellum</hi> only, ſuch as he calls the various Configuration of the Face, from ſome Impulſe or Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the <hi>Viſcera</hi> or elſewhere, erecting the Ears, turning the Neck and Eyes about, ſudden Shrieks and Outcries upon ſome extraordinary frightful Object ſurprizingly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one Senſe or another, furniſhed with either ſuch Nerves as he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to be altogether under the command of the <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> as the fifth and ſeventh, or elſe to have a very near correſpondence with that part by vertue of Vicinity, as the ninth, do more truly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from that perceptive faculty, or (to uſe his own words) that part of the Soul, he hath confin'd to that part of the Medullary Syſtem called the <hi>Cerebrum.</hi> inaſmuch as in reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Creatures they may and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are ſuſpended, as well as the Nerves they ſlow from, ſometimes made uſe of as Inſtruments of Voluntary Motion by it alſo; and to think the contrary, is as much
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:99585:91"/>as to ſay, that when any body happens to expreſs any of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd involuntary Acts, or but hit his Bedfellow a box of the Ear, whilſt aſleep, all theſe muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to proceed only from the Organ of Involuntary Motions called the <hi>Cerebellum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And of this kind alſo in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure I reckon Reſpiration, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which I cannot eaſily be brought to think it ſatisfactorily explain'd by Dr. <hi>Willis,</hi> from the Energy of thoſe Animal Spirits which flow only from the <hi>Cerebellum</hi> in the <hi>Par Vagum,</hi> after the ſame manner they do to the Heart by the Intercoſtal and that Pair for its pulſation, and as only under the command of the Soul, to be ſtopt now and then, as it pleaſes, by vertue of ſome Nerves communicated to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercoſtal Muſcles and Diaphragm, the chief Inſtruments of breathing, from the <hi>Spina Dorſi.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:99585:92"/>
               <p>I am therefore rather enclin'd to think this Motion is of the other different kind before ſpoken of, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Title of <hi>Inſtinct,</hi> proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from an extraneous ſuperve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Cauſe, acting conformably to the courſe of Nature in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Caſes of the ſame kind, as in Hunger and Thirſt, and the like, where the obtaining the deſigned End or Effect renders the part from whence comes the Motion for ſome time inſenſible of the impreſſion, and where, after the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ceaſing of the Effect or Motion, the ſenſe of the impreſſion revives again, whence there happens an equal reciproca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the Senſe and Fruition, or Senſe and Motion.</p>

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:99585:92"/>
                  <hi>Inſtinct,</hi> which I make to differ from purely <hi>Natural Motions,</hi> ſuch as are contemporary with even the firſt living Rudiments of the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual, was altogether and ſolely owing to the <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> after the manner of that of the Heart; then of neceſſity the Child in the Womb ought to reſpire. But being ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of the contrary, it remains that we account for its reſpiration ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, which is as afore noted, through the preſence or abſence of the firſt moving Cauſe or Impulſe, which I make or ſuppoſe to be any thing impreſſing the Nerves, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated through the Organs of Breathing, ſo as to tranſmit the impreſſion from within to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive Faculty, preſiding both over the <hi>Cerebrum</hi> and <hi>Cerebellum</hi> too, to the end the Spirits may from thence forthwith be commanded into ſuch other Nerves as act thoſe Muſcles which ſerve for enlarging the whole Cavity of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> in order to let the Air into the Lungs more plentifully, which was the thing aimed at by Nature; and theſe
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:99585:93"/>are the Intercoſtal Muſcles and Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragm.</p>
               <p>Now 'tis eaſie to conceive, that whilſt the Child is encloſed in its Mothers Belly, there is not that occaſion for Reſpiration as when 'tis born, the main Stream of Blood all that while finding no paſſage thro' them, and that which does by the <hi>Ruyſhian Artery</hi> made of Juices much more mild and cooler, the native heat being little, and the Aliment meer Chyle or Milk; from whence it falls out that the Pulmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The truth of this will the more clearly appear to any who will take the pains to conſider well of the ſtructure of Parts in Children
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:99585:93"/>unborn, in whom the uſual circuit of Blood through the Lungs, which are deſigned for rarifying and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the mixture of Blood and Chyle, is denyed; as alſo through the Liver, ſerving chiefly for ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating that groſs Excrement the Gall, not bred (at leaſt in any proportion) in an Infant unborn, and in lieu of theſe, other Paſſages, (which become altogether unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary after birth) provided by Nature after a ſhorter and more compendious way, <hi>(viz)</hi> by the <hi>Foramen Ovale</hi> betwixt the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> and <hi>Vena Pulmon.</hi> and <hi>Tubulus Arterio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> between the <hi>Art.

               </p>
               <p>'Tis true, That in ſeveral Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures there are ſome Nerves very much depending on the <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> as are they which miniſter (though in a different manner, as hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy been taken notice of, and will be hereafter further explained) to the Natural and Vital Functions, <hi>(viz.)</hi>

               <p>Yea, I have ſeen Reſpiration (which only in part depends on the <hi>Cerebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi>) totally to ceaſe upon only a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den violent compreſſion of that part by a blow, and, after its being woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the Heart to ceaſe beating im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.</p>

               <p>All which muſt of natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence fall out upon the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, That thoſe Functions of Nature do depend on the <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellum</hi> for their ſource and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, which is conſtant, uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and out of the arbitrary juriſdiction of the Brain; yet with this difference, that in Motions purely natural, and either contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary with the <hi>Embrio,</hi> as the firſt ſigns of its vitality, ſuch as is Pulſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Heart, during its encloſure within the Mother, or ſupervenient upon its further growth and more viſible organiſation of Parts, as the natural contraction of the other <hi>Viſcera</hi> ſubſervient to the offices of Protruſion of the Chyle, ſeparation of the Glandular Juices, and proſcription of the Excrements, the Animal Fluid or Spirits do alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether flow from the <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> the Nerves there both deſcending from the <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> and termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in thoſe parts afore-mentioned; whereas in Reſpiration, which I call a Motion of Supervenient Inſtinct, (if I may be allowed to uſe the word

               <p>So that all the office of the <hi>Par Vagum,</hi> which is propagated thro' the Lungs, is to convey the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion from thence to the <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellum,</hi> which by vertue of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion

               <p>And further; That this part is as capable thereof as the <hi>Cerebrum,</hi> and is not wholly and only deputed for the ſervice of ſuch Nerves or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans as are employed by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary part or portion of the Soul, (as Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> would have it) appears in that the third Pair of Nerves, by him allowed to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the number of the other kind of Nerves, <hi>(viz.)</hi> thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Will, from hence (as hath been already ſhewn) hath its original. And here alſo further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more give me leave to add, by way of conjecture, that the reaſon why the Soul hath not an equal command over thoſe afore mention'd Nerves dedicated to the vital and natural Motions, is, the early date
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:99585:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>or commencement of the office of thoſe Nerves, by which means they contract an habitual irreſiſtible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux, much leſs ſo in thoſe belonging to the Reſpiratory Functions, the exerciſe whereof is of a later date; and laſtly, the Influx is not in the leaſt ſo habitual in thoſe other ſubſervient to the Organical Functions of the Limbs, inaſmuch as they are not capable of being exerciſed till a much longer time after, and then not ſo uninterruptedly as either the firſt or the ſecond, but gradually, and with intermiſſions.</p>
               <p>So that the only reaſon why upon cutting the <hi>Cerebellum</hi> Reſpiration ceaſes, is, that by that means its ſtructure is diſcompoſed, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd unfit either to receive or tranſmit the impreſſion further to the aforeſaid Nerves, which are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to the Inſtruments of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, there arc reciprocal communications betwixt the Nerves of the <hi>Intercoſtal Pair, Vertebrae,</hi> and <hi>Diaphragm,</hi> yet ſeeing they termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate nor immediately in the Parts
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:99585:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>of each others particular diſtinct ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictions, there is no interchangeable act or office from thence produced betwixt them.</p>
               <p>For as, notwithſtanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there are ſo many Branches of Nerves com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated from the Spinal Nerves ſubſervient to voluntary motion, to the Intercoſtal Pair, on their deſcent to the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> and yet by reaſon of their not terminating in thoſe parts, they are not in the leaſt able to bring theſe Nerves under the commands of the Rational Soul, by which provident Care of Nature it ſo falls out, that 'tis not in the power of any, by miſguided Reaſon, to act injuriouſly to themſelves: So by vertue of ſeveral Branches re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally communicated from the Intercoſtal Pair in its paſſage down to the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> to the Spinal Nerves, there is no power given to them of moving the Muſcles to which they are ſubſervient uninterrupted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, after the meer manner of the <hi>Viſcera.</hi>

               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:99585:97"/>
               <p>But now, to return to where we left off, in ſome Creatures it's very plain, that Nature hath extended this imperial reſidence of the Soul beyond the <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> even as far as the <hi>Spinalis Medulla,</hi> having not only put this laſt motion, but that of Pulſation too, under the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of that elongation of the Brain; as appears in the famous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of the Induſtrious <hi>Caldeſi</hi> upon the Tortoiſe, which after the Head was cut off lived, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried its Shell about, the ſpace of ſix Months.</p>
               <p>Beſides which, 'tis remarkable, (by way of digreſſion) according to another Experiment by the aforeſaid Author made upon that Creature, that after even the Heart and all the <hi>Viſcera</hi> beſides, were taken out, except the Lungs, that Creature (to uſe his own Expreſſion) was ſound ſo to reſiſt Death, as to turn it ſelf from the inverted or ſupine poſition it had been placed in, in order to make the Experiment, to its prone or natural one, and to live and move ſix hours, after. From
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:99585:97"/>whence it appears, that <hi>Muſcular Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is capable of being performed by the Animal Fluid alone, without the concurrence of the Blood, by moſt Authors conſtantly hitherto made to go a ſhare therewith in the performance of that action.<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>So that we find Nature hath not ſtinted it ſelf to one place for the Seat of the Senſative Soul, or Reſervatories of the Animal Spirits ſo called, in order to the diſcharge of the afore-mention'd Functions, no more than it is at a loſs about the maintaining them in their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity by other ways, when it hath ſo fallen out that the natural ſtructure of the Organs, deſtin'd by Nature to that end, have utterly been deſtroy'd, of which we have many Inſtances in the <hi>Anatomical Hiſtory,</hi> thoſe Functions in ſeveral Creatures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining perfect, where after death there have been ſound neither any <hi>Cerebrum</hi> or <hi>Cerebellum</hi> at all, or at leaſt ſuch as by their conſtitution was utterly render'd uſeleſs to any ſuch end.</p>

               </p>
               <p>And as to the power or influence the Soul in general exerciſes over the Nerves, howſoever different in their original, ſeeing we have already obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved what a provident care Nature hath taken for the preſerving Creatures from their own violence, in that it hath not only conſtituted the chief Fountain from whence the great current of Spirits is derived, for the ſervice of the vital and natural parts, by the Eighth and Intercoſtal Nerves, which is the <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> ſo as to be free from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Rational Will in its or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way of acting, but hath alſo taken care that not any of thoſe Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which have their originals from Trunks, which are under the power of voluntary dictates of the Soul,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:99585:99"/>ſhould terminate in ſuch Organs by which thoſe Functions are diſcharg'd, (abare communication between Nerves of different Provinces not being ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſuch ends or offices, as hath been obſerved in thoſe afore-mention'd additional ſubſidiary ſmaller Streams of Spirits flowing to the parts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate to the natural and vital Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions by Branches propagated from the Spinal Marrow, to the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſtal Nerve, all the way of its deſcent to the lower <hi>Venter.</hi>)</p>
               <p>So we may further alſo remark, that as there are ſome manner of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions made upon the perceptive Faculty, after ſuch ſort of a manner as that it even loſes its power over its own Subjects, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Nerves, which are ſubſervient to its volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry commands, as in <hi>Laughing, Sneezing,</hi> and <hi>libidinous Erections,</hi> the Organs by which theſe Actions are produc'd, being altogether under the power of thoſe Nerves ſubſervient to the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary dictates of the Soul, and acted after the very ſame manner as thoſe of Reſpiration, as often as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable objects preſent, and (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the aſſertion of Dr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>

               <p>So, on the contrary, there are ſome Impreſſions made upon the Soul ſometimes, through which it acquires a power over thoſe Nerves at other times in no wiſe ſubject to it, and thoſe are the impreſſions either of great Joy or great Grief, ſuitable to which the Vital and Natural Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties are made either much more or elſe ſo much leſs vigorous than ordinary, as even quite to languiſh.</p>
               <p>How this comes to paſs, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> in ſavour of his own Hypotheſis, and particularly in relation to the firſt, (which allows of no Involuntary Motions, but what come from the Province of the <hi>Cerebellum</hi>) is explained by ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing an undulating or rowling mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the firſt impreſſion upon the Brain out of it again, through the Natiform Proceſſes into the <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebellum,</hi> and from thence by the Annular Proceſs into the Intercoſtal Pair of Nerves, and ſo to the Nerve of the Diaphragm, (and he ſhould, to make this way of explication
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:99585:101"/>entire, have taken in alſo all thoſe Vertebral Branches inſerted into the Intercoſtal Nerve, in order to the moving of the Intercoſtal Muſcles, without which that action cannot be performed) by a correſpondence between which Nerves and thoſe of the Face, being all of one family, the aforeſaid Geſture of Laughing is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
               <p>Now, beſides the needleſneſs of bringing the Conceptions or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the Brain under a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of being executed by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Province of the <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> till ſuch time as 'tis proved, that ſuch motions of the Spirits, upon extraordinary occaſions, may ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally be granted, without ſuppoſing a regular motion of the ſame through ſuch ſuppoſed Paſſages lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from one Part to the other at all other times, (the allowing whereof does neceſſarily imply a capacity of the Soul to alter the courſe of the Spirits influencing the vital and natural Organs, at leaſt in ſome meaſure, at its pleaſure, which is plainly contrary to Experience;) I ſhall hardly look upon that Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:99585:101"/>to be any more than meerly precarious.</p>
               <p>And further, to ſhew, that ſuch Effects or Alterations of the Vital Organs happening upon violent Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Mind, are no way owing to ſuch a tranſmiſſion of the Animal Fluid from the <hi>Cerebrum</hi> to the <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> as the aforeſaid Author ſuppoſeth, I ask, how it ſhould come to paſs that in the contrary Paſſion of Grief, eſpecially when occaſion'd by ſurprizing frightful Accidents, the Heart ſhould ſo languiſh, as ſometimes wholly to ceaſe beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſeeing in the aforeſaid Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment we find that Motion ſelf-ſufficient, by vertue of a conſtant irradiation or influence of the <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebellum</hi> only, and conſequently could not be thought ſo to languiſh upon ſuch occaſions for want of thoſe Spirits it never ſtood in need of.</p>
               <p>Without therefore being forc'd to have recourſe to that other Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis clogg'd with ſo many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, I think the aforeſaid caſe may admit of another manner of expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, conſiſtent with what I have all-along advanc'd upon this Subject
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:99585:102"/>relating to the true ſource of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary and involuntary Actions: if we ſuppoſe, that from ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions upon the Soul as are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extreamly more or leſs wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to it, (in which caſe the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is ſaid to act unproportionably upon the Subject) it may not only act accordingly, above its uſual irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation and force over the <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> and by that means, as ſending the Spirits either more or leſs copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to the Vital Organs, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the Heart, the neareſt way, <hi>(viz.)</hi> by the <hi>Par Vagum</hi> and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercoſtal Pair, for that time render them more vigorous, or more lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid in their operations, in proportion to the difference of the Paſſions, juſt after the manner it happens in caſes of Alienation of Mind or Diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, where by the Strength of the Impreſſion, or <hi>Idea</hi> upon the Mind, it drives the Spirits with ſuch an <hi>impetus</hi> into the Limbs, as makes them act with a vaſt greater force than what they were wont to do, even above the reſiſtance of Chains or Bars of Iron; but alſo it may tranſmit the Spirits more or leſs co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:99585:102"/>to the Vital and Natural Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, the other way freed from the ſubſidiary Nerves of the <hi>Spina</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, to the Intercoſtal Pair, which ſends forth ramifications to the Heart (in Men eſpecially) equally with, if not more plentifully than the <hi>Par Vagum,</hi> and from the Vertebral and Brachial to the Nerve of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragm and Intercoſtal Muſcles, by which means it ſo falls out, upon ſuch impreſſions, that the Organs of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration to the <hi>ſight,</hi> and that of Pulſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>touch,</hi> are very remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly affected.</p>
               <p>By this means I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to reſtore the Brain to a capacity of putting its own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions or Impreſſions made upon it into execution, without being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to its neighbour the <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellum,</hi> and that either in relation to its voluntary, inadvertent, or involuntary Acts; where, note, I make a diſtinction between Acts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary and thoſe of inadverten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, inaſmuch as theſe laſt, though they are not with, yet they are not contrary to the actual conſent of the Will, after the manner of the natural actions of the <hi>Viſcera,</hi>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:99585:103"/>ſuch as are out of the power of the Will to hinder; beſides which, I look upon no other in Rational Creatures (in a ſtrict ſence conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd) to be involuntary, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as 'tis a contradiction to ſay a Voluntary Agent does any thing againſt his Rational Will (though it may be againſt his Approbation) by which he is only diſtinguiſh'd from a Brute: Though Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> hath all-along uſed the word <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntario</hi> in another ſence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding it with acts of meer Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance under the term of <hi>Inſciè,</hi> and thoſe alſo done only inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently, or without conſideration, under the term of <hi>Inconſulto;</hi> and doubtleſs upon this notion of Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Motions built his Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, which makes all thoſe Actions which are perform'd at any time without the notice of the Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Faculty, notwithſtanding at other times they are altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its command, equally depending on the <hi>Cerebellum</hi> as thoſe purely na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, which are always free from the power of the firſt, and alſo abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubject to the laſt.</p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:99585:103"/>
               <p>Theſe Actions I have therefore called by the term of <hi>Supervenient Inſtinct,</hi> and being the meer Effect of external or internal Impreſſions upon Senſative Bodies, as Ecchoes are to thoſe upon ſuch as are only natural, are equally competent to Rational and Irrational Creatures, and capable of being exerted by the influence of the very ſame Nerves which miniſter to the Senſative Faculty, whether it act advertently or inadvertently in the one, or <hi>ſpontaneouſly</hi> in the other, (where, by the way, it may not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unworthy of our taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, the genuine ſence of that word in Actions performed by thoſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is much nearer a-kin to the term <hi>Inconſulto</hi> than <hi>Involuntario</hi> in Men) without the ſuppoſed rambling Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Impreſſions made upon it, (through Paſſages only at ſome times or upon eztraordinary occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made uſe of) out of the <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brum</hi> into the <hi>Cerebellum.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And to this End or great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice it looks as though this Proceſs was furniſhed with ſuch a Texture as it appears to have, of ſtrong, large, medullary <hi>Striae's,</hi> capable of receiving and containing a Supply from both Fountains.</p>

               <p>Whence it may not be unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to remark, That not without ſhew of good Reaſon I have all-along aſſerted the Propriety of the Brain to thoſe Nerves in part, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> to be no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affected by any Impreſſions of the Brain, than as firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed from it into the Province of the <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to depend immediately on this laſt for influence entirely in order to convey Animal Spirits to thoſe parts wherein they are inſerted.</p>
               <p>Upon the <hi>Caudex Medullaris,</hi> on its under ſide contiguous to the hinder Extremities of the Annular Proceſs, are ſituate the <hi>Corpora Pyramidalia</hi> and <hi>Olivaria,</hi> over-againſt which are the two long Medullary Tracts lately taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, ſeeming to come from the tranſverſe Medullary Proceſs behind the <hi>Teſtes,</hi> and terminating in thoſe other tranſverſe Medullary Proceſſes before the entrance into the Fourth Ventricle on the other
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:99585:108"/>ſide, by which there may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed a conſiderable Portion of the Animal Fluid to the Pathetick Nerve, which hath its riſe from the firſt tranſverſe Proceſs, and to the ſoft or ſecond Branch of the Auditory Nerve, which hath its riſe from the ſecond on that ſide, and alſo to the Ninth and Tenth Pair on the other ſide.</p>
               <p>And to conclude, From all theſe taken together, with the reſt of the whole medullary part of the Brain, the <hi>Overplus</hi> of what is not ſpent upon the inmate Nerves of the Brain may truly be ſuppoſed to be promiſcuouſly diſpenſed to all thoſe other extraneous ones produced from the elongation of the Brain, call'd the <hi>Spinal Marrow.</hi> In which laſt there is this conformation or diſpoſition of Parts differing from that of the Brain, that whereas in that the cineritious part is external, 'tis here internal; and this for very good reaſon, and by a provident contrivance of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſeeing that not only the cine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritious part of the Brain ſerves for
